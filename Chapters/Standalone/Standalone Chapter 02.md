# Chapter 2

# Encryption and Honesty

Astrid had sent the text at eleven PM, after three false starts and a glass of wine she'd poured but not finished: *Need your professional expertise on a sensitive matter. Coffee tomorrow if you're available?*

Benedict's reply had come within minutes: *Intrigued. Midtown? 2pm?*

Now it was 2:17, her second cappuccino was going cold, and she was rehearsing her pitch for the dozenth time in her head while trying not to look like someone preparing to propose a fake engagement to a near-stranger.

The coffee shop was one of those aggressively modern Midtown places—exposed brick, reclaimed wood, succulents in concrete planters—filled with the usual afternoon mix of remote workers, tourists recovering from MoMA, and people like her conducting meetings that couldn't happen in offices. Astrid had chosen a table in the back corner, away from the window, which now felt paranoid but she couldn't change seats without looking unstable.

She adjusted her glasses. Checked her phone. Forced herself to stop checking her phone.

At 2:19, Benedict Shaw pushed through the door in a wave of October wind and scattered apologies.

"Sorry, sorry—the subway stopped dead in the tunnel for ten minutes, something about signal problems." He unwound a grey scarf from his neck, shrugging out of a worn leather jacket to reveal a faded Joy Division t-shirt under a charcoal blazer that had seen better days. His dark hair was disheveled in that way that looked artfully careless but was probably just the result of running his hands through it too many times. "You said sensitive matter. I've been imagining increasingly elaborate forgery scenarios all afternoon. Please tell me it involves secret societies."

He smiled—crooked, genuinely pleased to see her—and Astrid felt some of her carefully constructed composure slip.

She'd forgotten this about him. How he managed to be both distracted and intensely present, how his accent made even mundane observations sound more interesting, how those blue-grey eyes seemed to catalog details the way she cataloged manuscript conditions.

"Coffee first," she said. "Then elaborate scenarios."

"Right." He joined the order line, and she watched him unconsciously tap a pattern against his leg while waiting—some rhythm only he could hear, fingers moving like he was encoding something invisible. When he returned with a black coffee and folded himself into the chair across from her, she was struck by how different he looked from the colleagues she usually worked with. Jonathan Rhys wore Tom Ford and handmade shoes. Benedict Shaw looked like he'd gotten dressed in the dark from a pile of clothes that had been kicked around a Brooklyn apartment.

She found it inexplicably appealing, which was not helpful.

"So," he said, wrapping both hands around his cup. "Sensitive matter. I'm all yours."

Astrid pulled out her phone and opened the Cardano manuscript photos. Started with what she knew, what was safe and professional: the discovery, the authentication, the significance of the find. She showed him images of the cipher blocks, and she watched his expression sharpen immediately into that particular focus she remembered from the Victorian diary case.

"May I?" He gestured toward her phone, and when she handed it to him, he zoomed in on the cipher, tilted his head. "These groupings—four and five letter blocks, no obvious repetition pattern in the first several lines. Not a simple substitution cipher. Cardano was ahead of his time cryptographically, if I remember correctly. Published one of the first texts on cipher theory."

"1550," Astrid confirmed. "De Subtilitate. He described several encryption methods, including a cipher disk system."

"And you think this manuscript contains encrypted intelligence about the Italian Wars?" Benedict looked up from the phone, and there was genuine excitement in his voice. "Political information dangerous enough to keep secret for centuries?"

"Possibly. If it's authentic."

"Which is where I assume the sensitive matter comes in." He handed back her phone, took a sip of coffee, watching her over the rim with those too-perceptive eyes. "You need authentication. What's the obstacle?"

This was it. The moment she either committed to this absurd plan or found another way.

Except there was no other way.

Astrid set her phone down, aligned it precisely with the edge of the table, and met his gaze. "The manuscript came from the estate of Vivienne Ashford. Her cousin, Lord Edmund Ashford, maintains the family's private collection in Cornwall—the most comprehensive collection of Cardano materials outside of Italy. I need access to his library for comparative analysis. Authentication without it would be professionally inadequate."

"Right. So you contact Lord Ashford, arrange access, bring me in as cryptography consultant. Standard procedure."

"Lord Ashford only grants access to committed couples."

Benedict's coffee cup paused halfway to his mouth. "I'm sorry, what?"

"His wife died five years ago. Since then, he's refused to meet with anyone who isn't in a stable, committed relationship. According to his secretary, he believes only people who understand lasting commitment can be trusted with items of both historical and sentimental value."

Benedict set down his cup carefully. She watched him process this information, saw the exact moment understanding clicked into place.

"You need a fake fiancé." Not a question. A statement of fact delivered in that dry British way that made it unclear whether he was amused or appalled.

"Partner," Astrid corrected, then realized it didn't matter. "Yes."

"For how long?"

She'd anticipated this question, had spent the previous evening researching exactly what authentication would require. "Authentication takes at least a week on-site, possibly longer. Mrs. Penrose indicated that Lord Ashford expects to meet couples over several days to 'get to know them properly.' We'd need to be convincing."

Benedict sat back in his chair, ran a hand through his hair—the gesture she remembered, making it stand up at odd angles. His fingers were long, elegant despite the restless energy. She'd noticed his hands during the Victorian diary case, the way they moved when he was thinking, sketching invisible patterns in the air.

"And you're asking me because..."

"Because you're a cryptographer. I'd need to bring one anyway to examine the encrypted content. And because—" She hesitated, then decided on honesty. "Because we barely know each other, which makes this simpler. No complicated existing relationship to navigate. Just a professional arrangement."

"A professional fake engagement."

"Committed partnership," Astrid said again, though hearing it out loud made her realize how absurd the distinction was. "We wouldn't need to claim we're engaged, specifically. Just together. Seriously together."

Benedict was quiet for a long moment, studying her with an expression she couldn't entirely read. His fingers tapped that invisible rhythm against his coffee cup—she noticed he did this when thinking, some unconscious encoding of his thought process.

"What do I get out of this arrangement?" he asked finally.

Fair question. She'd prepared for this too.

"Full access to the cipher. If this manuscript is authentic—if it contains what I think it contains—decoding it would be a significant academic contribution. You could publish, present at conferences, establish yourself as the foremost authority on Renaissance cryptography." She paused. "I know your ex-wife is a more prominent scholar in the field. This would be yours."

Something flickered across his face. Not quite pain, but close.

"You've done your research," he said quietly.

"I'm good at research."

"Right." He looked down at his coffee, then back at her. "And you'd pay standard consulting rates for the decryption work?"

"Of course."

Another silence. Outside the window, Manhattan moved through its afternoon rhythms—taxis, pedestrians, the constant hum of the city. Inside this coffee shop, Astrid waited for Benedict Shaw to agree to the most ridiculous proposition of her professional life.

"When would we start?" he asked.

Relief flooded through her, though she kept her voice level. "Soon. I need to contact Mrs. Penrose with confirmation. Then we'd need to prepare—backstory, relationship history, make it believable."

"Believable to a grieving widower who's eccentric enough to require committed couples for library access." Benedict's tone was wry. "No pressure, then."

"I wouldn't ask if there were another option."

"But there isn't." He nodded slowly. "Because this is your Gutenberg Bible, isn't it? Your career-making acquisition."

She wanted to deny it, to pretend she was motivated purely by scholarly interest, but that would be dishonest. And if they were going to do this, they might as well start with truth.

"Yes," she said. "Partnership decisions were made yesterday. I assume they chose Jonathan Rhys. This manuscript could change that."

"So we're both building our reputations on Renaissance secrets and elaborate deception." He smiled, but there was something sad underneath it. "Seems fitting, somehow."

"Benedict—"

"No, I'm in." He leaned forward, suddenly all business. "But we do this properly. If we're going to lie to a lonely old man about being in love, we'd better be bloody convincing about it. Which means preparation. Planning. Making this believable enough that he doesn't question it."

Astrid pulled out her notebook, uncapped her pen. Back to familiar territory: logistics, planning, the practical details that made impossible things possible.

"Cover story first," she said, writing the header. "How we met—that's easy. The Victorian diary case six months ago. That's true."

"How we reconnected recently. Ran into each other at a lecture? Gallery opening?" Benedict tilted his head, thinking. "Something book-related. The Morgan Library does evening programs."

"That works. Lecture on Renaissance manuscripts, we both attended, went for coffee after." Astrid made notes in her precise handwriting. "Discovered shared interests beyond work, started seeing each other."

"How long have we been together?"

"Three months? Long enough to be serious, not so long that there's expected history we can't fabricate."

"Right. Three months ago was July. Summer. We could have spent time together—weekends away, that sort of thing." He was getting into it now, she could see him constructing the narrative the way he'd construct a cipher solution. "Where did I propose?"

"You haven't proposed yet," Astrid said quickly. "We're just committed. Seriously together. That's what Mrs. Penrose asked about—commitment, not engagement specifically."

"Semantics. If Lord Ashford is romantic enough to require couples only, he'll want to know our intentions. Whether we're building toward something."

He wasn't wrong. She made another note. "Fine. We're discussing future plans. Considering moving in together."

"Are we?"

"No, that's too complicated. We're both keeping our own places but spending significant time together." She looked up. "Your place or mine for the backstory?"

"Yours. Mine's a disaster—I'd never convince anyone I was responsible enough for a committed relationship if they saw it."

Astrid felt herself almost smile. "We stay at yours on weekends, mine during the work week. That's why we haven't moved in together yet—we both value our space but we're compromising."

"Very practical. Very us, actually."

"There is no 'us,'" Astrid said. "That's the point."

"Right. But the fictional us. We need to build characters here, and making them close to our real selves makes the deception easier to maintain." Benedict leaned back, fingers drumming that pattern again. "So. Fictional us met at the Morgan Library, discovered we both love rare books and cryptographic puzzles, started dating. We're both career-focused, which is actually why it works—we understand each other's obsessions. I'm disorganized but brilliant—"

"Modest, too."

"—and you're precise and skeptical but passionate about your work. We balance each other."

Despite everything, Astrid found herself caught by the story they were building. It sounded almost real. Almost like something that could have happened, in some other timeline where she was brave enough to act on attraction instead of cataloging all the reasons not to.

"What do we do together?" she asked. "Couples have activities, shared interests beyond work."

"Museums. Obviously. Book fairs, antiquarian shows. Walks through the city." He paused. "I climb. Bouldering, mostly. You could have come with me a few times, tried it."

"Have I?"

"Tried climbing?"

"In our backstory."

Benedict's eyes lit with something that looked like genuine amusement. "Yes. You were terrible at it but you appreciated the problem-solving aspect. Liked the way routes are like puzzles."

"I'm not terrible at physical activities."

"I know. But in the story, you're a bit out of your element with climbing, which makes it endearing. Shows you're willing to try things for me."

Astrid wrote it down, feeling oddly defensive about her fictional self's climbing abilities. "What have you tried for me?"

"Opera. I hate opera, but you love it, so I've suffered through several performances at the Met."

"I don't love opera."

"But fictional you does. See? We're building complete characters here."

They spent the next forty minutes hammering out details. First date: Italian restaurant in the West Village, talked for four hours. Second date: walking tour of rare bookshops in Brooklyn, Benedict bought her a vintage text on medieval cryptography. The moment things shifted from friendly to romantic: caught in a thunderstorm, sheltering under an awning outside the Strand, he'd kissed her.

Astrid wrote down "first kiss in thunderstorm" and felt her face warm for no logical reason.

They created memories: a weekend trip to Boston to see the Houghton Library collection. Cooking disasters in his kitchen. Inside jokes about terrible academic mysteries. The small intimacies that made relationships real—his habit of making her tea exactly how she liked it, her patience with his tendency to lose track of time when solving problems.

The details accumulated in her notebook, and with each addition, the fiction felt more solid. More possible.

Benedict checked his watch—old silver, worn on his left wrist, his father's, he'd mentioned during the Victorian diary case. "We should establish ground rules."

"Agreed." Astrid turned to a fresh page. "Boundaries. This is a professional arrangement. We maintain the fiction only when necessary—when we're at Ashford Hall, when we're in character. Otherwise, normal colleague relationship."

"Duration: ends once the manuscript is authenticated and the cipher is decoded."

"No actual relationship expectations," Astrid continued writing. "No romantic involvement beyond what's required for the performance."

"Strictly professional."

"Strictly professional," she echoed, underlining it.

They looked at each other across the table, and something in Benedict's expression made her pulse quicken. He was attractive—she'd noticed that during their first collaboration, had deliberately not thought about it too much—but now she was acutely aware of the fact that she'd just agreed to pretend to be in love with him.

"Right then," Benedict said, breaking the moment. "When do you contact Mrs. Penrose?"

"Tomorrow. I'll confirm we can visit, get dates arranged. Then we'll need to coordinate our calendars, book travel."

"I'll need access to the manuscript photos to start preliminary cipher analysis. Build familiarity with Cardano's methods before we're on-site."

Astrid pulled out her phone, started AirDropping him the images. "I'll send everything I have. Provenance documentation too, in case it's helpful for context."

Her phone buzzed with his acceptance, and they sat there in the coffee shop's afternoon light, surrounded by the evidence of their conspiracy—notebooks full of fabricated history, phones exchanging encrypted images, coffee cups empty.

"This is insane," Astrid said quietly.

"Completely." Benedict stood, gathering his jacket and scarf. "But if you're going to do something insane, might as well do it properly. I'll wait for your call about dates." He wound the scarf around his neck, smiled that crooked smile. "Astrid? This cipher—if it's real, if it's what you think—we might be opening something that people encrypted for very good reasons. Renaissance political intelligence, dangerous enough to hide for centuries. Just... be prepared for what we might find."

The warmth she'd felt moments ago chilled. He was right. Authentication wasn't just about establishing truth—it was about unleashing whatever truth had been deliberately hidden.

"I know," she said. "But it's my job to authenticate truth, whatever that truth is."

Benedict nodded slowly, something in his expression shifting to what looked like respect. "Right then. I'll wait for your call, darling."

The endearment was deliberate, playful—testing the shape of their fiction in his mouth. It landed with more impact than he'd probably intended, intimate and strange and charged with possibility.

Before Astrid could respond, he was gone, pushing back out into Manhattan's crowds, leaving her alone with her empty cup and the feeling that she'd just set something in motion she didn't entirely understand.

She looked down at her notebook where she'd written "RULES" and underlined it twice. The word "professional" was circled.

Her phone sat on the table, her reflection distorted in its dark screen.

Astrid picked it up and pulled up Mrs. Penrose's contact information. Her thumb hovered over the call button.

Last chance to back out. Find another authentication method, accept that some opportunities were too complicated, too compromising.

She thought about the Cardano manuscript's cipher blocks. About partnership. About Benedict's voice saying "darling" with that mix of mockery and something that wasn't entirely mockery.

About whether being the best at her job meant being willing to become someone she wasn't.

Her reflection stared back at her from the phone screen, hazel eyes uncertain.

Astrid pressed call.

The phone rang twice before Mrs. Penrose answered. "Ashford Hall."

"Mrs. Penrose, this is Astrid Whitlock. We spoke yesterday about the Cardano manuscript authentication." Her voice was steady, professional, giving nothing away. "I'm calling to confirm that my partner and I would like to arrange a visit to Lord Ashford's estate. We're available for an extended stay—one to two weeks, whatever Lord Ashford prefers."

"Wonderful, Miss Whitlock. Let me check His Lordship's calendar. When were you thinking?"

They arranged dates: three weeks out, giving her time to finish current projects and Benedict time to prepare his cipher analysis. Mrs. Penrose was efficient and warm, clearly pleased to be facilitating a visit from a "committed couple."

When Astrid hung up, her hands were shaking.

She gathered her things—notebook full of lies, phone full of secrets, the dregs of cold coffee—and walked out into the October afternoon. The city was sharp and bright around her, all glass and steel and the particular energy New York had as day shifted toward evening.

She'd just lied to Mrs. Penrose. Soon she'd lie to Lord Ashford. She was about to spend weeks in Cornwall pretending to be in love with a man she barely knew, all to authenticate a manuscript that might contain dangerous historical truths.

Everything she'd built her career on—honesty, evidence, verifiable fact—was about to be compromised by the most elaborate fiction she'd ever constructed.

But the alternative was watching Jonathan Rhys get partnership while she stayed exactly where she was, cataloging other people's acquisitions, playing it safe.

Astrid walked toward the subway, her notebook pressed against her chest like armor, and tried to convince herself that the flutter of anticipation under her ribs was purely professional interest in the Cardano manuscript.

It was a lie she told herself with all the conviction she'd bring to authenticating a forgery.

Which is to say: not much at all.

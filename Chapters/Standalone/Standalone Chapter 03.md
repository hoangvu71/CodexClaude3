# Chapter 3

# Constructing the Narrative

Benedict had been pacing his Williamsburg loft for twenty minutes, which was approximately nineteen minutes longer than any reasonable person should pace before what was essentially a work meeting.

Except it wasn't a work meeting. It was a conspiracy planning session. A fiction construction workshop. A rehearsal for an elaborate deception that would require him to pretend to be in love with Astrid Whitlock while deceiving a lonely widower for access to rare manuscripts.

When he put it like that, it sounded worse.

He stopped pacing and looked around his apartment with the sudden horrified clarity of seeing it through someone else's eyes. The bookshelves that lined two walls were overflowing, volumes stacked horizontally on top of other volumes, cryptography texts mixed with vintage paperbacks and climbing guides in no discernible order. His whiteboards—three of them, salvaged from a Columbia classroom renovation—were covered in half-erased equations and cipher analyses, fragments of problems he'd gotten bored with or stuck on. His climbing gear occupied one corner in a tangled heap: shoes, chalk bag, rope he kept meaning to organize. The keyboard he'd bought after the divorce, thinking he'd finally learn to play properly, sat against the far wall gathering dust and supporting a stack of unread academic journals.

The breakfast dishes were still in the sink. His laundry was definitely visible in the bedroom.

Benedict ran a hand through his hair and made a quick circuit: dishes into the dishwasher, laundry shoved into the closet, papers on the dining table organized into a single neat stack. The whiteboards he left—erasing them felt like admitting defeat, and besides, they were evidence of work. Professional work. The kind of work that made him a legitimate cryptography consultant rather than just some guy with a PhD and too much time.

He was overthinking this. Astrid was coming over to prepare their cover story. That was all. Professional collaboration.

The fact that he'd thought about her more than strictly necessary since the coffee shop meeting three days ago was irrelevant.

The intercom buzzed at precisely four PM.

"It's Astrid," her voice said through the speaker, and Benedict pressed the button to let her in, then spent the next minute and a half she'd need to climb the stairs trying to look casual instead of like he'd been anxiously preparing.

When he opened the door, she was standing in the hallway with her leather satchel and an expression that suggested she was also overthinking this.

She looked different than she had at the coffee shop. More relaxed, maybe. Or just differently armored. Dark jeans instead of work trousers, a forest green sweater that brought out the gold in her hazel eyes, her auburn hair pulled back in a ponytail rather than the severe bun she'd worn before. She was still wearing the tortoiseshell glasses, still had that appraising look that made him feel like she was cataloging him the way she'd catalog a manuscript.

"Come in," he said, stepping back. "Fair warning: it's not as organized as your office probably is."

"My office is professionally organized. My apartment is... less so." But she was looking around his loft with those assessing eyes, taking in the books, the whiteboards, the climbing gear. She paused at the keyboard, touched one key lightly. "Do you play?"

"Not well. I keep meaning to practice. It's good for pattern recognition, supposedly—mapping music theory to mathematical relationships. But I get distracted by other problems." He heard himself rambling and stopped. "Tea? Coffee? I have both."

"Tea would be nice."

He moved to the kitchen area—the loft was open plan, everything visible—and filled the kettle. Astrid set her bag on the dining table and continued her exploration of his space, pausing at the bookshelves.

"Your organization system is chaos," she observed, but her tone was more fascinated than critical. "Renaissance history next to cyberpunk novels next to Gödel, Escher, Bach."

"I know where everything is. It's organized by... by the order I acquired things, basically. Temporal rather than categorical." He got down mugs, found the good tea—loose leaf, because he might be disorganized but he wasn't a barbarian. "You can judge me. Everyone does."

"I'm not judging. I'm trying to understand your filing system." She pulled out a volume—one of his cryptography textbooks, margins full of his notes. "You annotate extensively."

"Helps me think. Writing in margins, making connections between ideas. It's all pattern recognition, really. Cryptography, music, even climbing routes. Just different languages for the same underlying structures."

Astrid looked at him over the top of the book, and something in her expression softened. "That's... actually that's a beautiful way to think about it."

The kettle boiled. Benedict poured water over tea leaves, grateful for something to do with his hands. When he brought the mugs to the table, Astrid had her notebook out and was sitting in one of his mismatched chairs, ready for business.

The late afternoon light slanted through the tall windows—one of the reasons he'd taken this place, the light—and outside he could hear Brooklyn's constant soundtrack: traffic, construction somewhere, someone's music bass-heavy through apartment walls.

"So," Astrid said. "Cover story refinement. We have the basics, but we should build out more detail. Lord Ashford will ask questions, and we need consistent answers."

Benedict sat across from her, wrapped his hands around his tea mug. "Right. Let's build a relationship."

They started with timeline, working backward from the present. Three months together. First meeting at the Morgan Library lecture in July. Coffee afterward. Discovery of shared interests. The progression from colleagues to friends to something more.

"First date," Astrid said, pen poised. "We said Italian restaurant in the West Village. Should we be more specific? In case he asks?"

"L'Artusi," Benedict said. The name came to him immediately, a place he actually liked, small and warm. "We talked for four hours. Closed the place down. You told me about your thesis research on Renaissance manuscript preservation techniques, and I told you about my work on breaking Vigenère variants. The waiter had to ask us to leave."

Astrid wrote it down, but she was smiling slightly. "That's very specific."

"Verisimilitude. The more detail we have, the more real it feels." He took a sip of tea, watching her write in that precise hand. "Second date: rare bookshops in Brooklyn. We walked from DUMBO to Park Slope, stopped at every antiquarian dealer. I bought you a vintage cryptography text."

"Which text?"

"Alberti's De componendis cifris. 1467 edition, or as close to it as I could find. Seemed fitting."

"That would be expensive."

"I'm trying to impress you. In the story." He felt his face warm slightly. "Also it's a gift you'd actually appreciate. No flowers, no jewelry. A fifteenth-century cryptography manual."

Astrid's smile widened. "I would appreciate that more than flowers."

"I know."

The words hung between them, more loaded than they should be. Benedict cleared his throat and continued: "The moment things shifted. We said thunderstorm, outside the Strand. Mid-August. One of those sudden summer storms. We were looking at books inside, came out to find it pouring. Sheltered under the awning with a dozen other people, but it felt like we were alone. I kissed you. You kissed me back."

He watched Astrid write "first kiss in thunderstorm" and saw her hand hesitate, just for a moment, before continuing.

"What happened after?" she asked, not looking up.

"After the kiss? We got drenched running to the subway. You came back to my place to dry off. We talked until three AM. That's when I knew it was serious."

"What did we talk about?"

"Everything. Your grandmother who was a librarian, who taught you to love old books. My sister Emma, who thinks I'm brilliant but impractical. The fact that we're both bad at relationships for exactly opposite reasons—you're afraid of not being enough, I'm afraid of being too much."

Astrid looked up sharply. "That's not in the cover story. That's real."

"Is it?" Benedict held her gaze. "Because it seems like it could be true. For the fictional us."

She looked away first, back to her notebook. "What else?"

They built out memories. The weekend trip to Boston—drove up on a Saturday, spent Sunday at the Houghton Library examining their collection, stayed at a small hotel near Harvard Square. Cooking disasters in his kitchen: he was a competent cook, but she kept trying to help and kept getting distracted by work emails, resulting in burnt pasta and smoke alarms. Inside jokes: they'd invented a drinking game for terrible academic mystery novels, took turns reading passages aloud and drinking every time someone said "priceless artifact" or "ancient secret."

The details accumulated, and with each addition, Benedict felt the story becoming more solid. More real. He could see these moments in his mind—walking through Brooklyn with Astrid, pointing out interesting architecture while she noticed bookshop windows. Sitting in his kitchen while she laughed at his description of a particularly awful mystery novel. Waking up next to her in Boston, early morning light through cheap hotel curtains.

None of it had happened. All of it felt true.

"We need to know personal things," Astrid said, breaking his reverie. "Lord Ashford will ask about our families, our lives. Information that couples would know about each other."

"Right. Family." Benedict set down his tea. "Parents divorced when I was twelve. Dad remarried, lives in Edinburgh, works in finance. We're cordial but not close. Mum's in Brighton, teaches primary school. We talk weekly. Younger sister, Emma, she's a teacher in Manchester. Married, two kids. I'm the fun uncle who visits twice a year and brings completely inappropriate educational gifts."

"What kind of inappropriate gifts?"

"Last Christmas I gave my seven-year-old nephew a book on codebreaking and a decoder ring. Emma said he spent three weeks leaving encrypted notes everywhere. She was less than thrilled."

Astrid was almost laughing. "That sounds exactly like something you'd do."

"What about your family?"

The laughter faded. Astrid touched the cameo brooch at her collar—he'd noticed she did that when uncertain or emotional. "Parents died in a car accident when I was nine. I was raised by my grandmother, my mother's mother. She was a librarian at the New York Public Library. She's the one who taught me about rare books, about the importance of preservation. She died when I was twenty-two, left me her collection and this brooch."

"I'm sorry," Benedict said quietly.

"It was a long time ago. But she's why I do what I do. Why authentication matters so much. She believed in preserving truth, in making sure the real things survived." Astrid looked down at her notebook. "I have a younger sister, Emily. She's in Seattle, works in tech. We're close but we don't see each other often. She thinks I work too much."

"Do you?"

"Yes. But so do you, so we understand that about each other. In the story."

Benedict nodded. "What else? Favorites, fears, the kind of things you tell someone at three AM?"

"Favorite books. You said Gödel, Escher, Bach?"

"For me, yes. You?"

"Anything by Umberto Eco. Name of the Rose, especially. The medieval mystery in the library—it's what made me want to work with rare manuscripts."

"Music?"

"Classical when I'm working. Baroque, mostly. Bach, Vivaldi. You?"

"Post-punk. Joy Division, The Cure, New Order. The darker the better. Emma says I'm perpetually stuck in my undergraduate angst phase." He tapped his fingers on the table, that unconscious pattern. "What are you afraid of?"

The question was supposed to be about their fictional selves, but it came out more personal than he'd intended.

Astrid was quiet for a moment. "Being ordinary. Doing work that doesn't matter. Getting to the end of my life and realizing I played it safe and missed everything important." She looked at him. "You?"

"Being alone with my thoughts. Which is why I always have a puzzle to solve, a problem to decode. If I stop working, I have to confront the fact that I'm not very good at the parts of life that don't involve patterns and solutions."

"Like relationships."

"Like relationships." Benedict swallowed. "My divorce. Clare. That probably needs to be part of our story—you'd know about it."

"What would I know?"

"That we were married for six years. That she's also an academic, more successful than me, more published. That she left because I was never present, always lost in whatever puzzle I was solving. She needed someone who could be there, emotionally, and I was always elsewhere." The words tasted like failure. "She wasn't wrong."

Astrid reached across the table, covered his hand with hers. The touch was light, probably meant to be comforting, but Benedict felt it like electricity.

"My ex-fiancé Steven," she said quietly. "He took a tenure-track position at Berkeley. Asked me to come with him, leave Marlowe & Sons, start over. I said no. He said I was too focused on my career to build a real life anyway." Her fingers tightened on his. "He wasn't entirely wrong either."

They sat there in the fading afternoon light, hands touching across the table, sharing failures they'd dressed up as cover story details.

"We're a mess," Benedict said.

"Yes. But at least we're a compatible mess. Fictional us, I mean."

"Right. Fictional."

Astrid pulled her hand back, and Benedict felt the absence of her touch more than he should.

The light through the windows was going gold, that particular autumn quality that made everything seem nostalgic. They'd been working for over two hours, building a relationship from component parts—memories and inside jokes, vulnerable admissions and fabricated intimacy.

"We should practice," Benedict heard himself say.

"Practice what?"

"Physical intimacy. Small gestures, casual touches. The kind of things couples do without thinking." He stood, suddenly restless. "If we're stiff and awkward around each other, Lord Ashford will notice immediately. We need to be comfortable with contact."

Astrid set down her pen slowly. "What kind of contact?"

"Hand-holding. Standing close. My arm around your shoulders, that sort of thing." He walked around the table, offered his hand. "May I?"

She looked at his hand for a moment before taking it, standing. They faced each other in his living room, holding hands like awkward teenagers, and Benedict was acutely aware of every point of contact: her cool fingers, the calluses on her index finger and thumb from handling documents, the way her pulse beat visibly at her wrist.

"This is strange," Astrid said.

"Very strange. But necessary." He laced their fingers together, the gesture deliberately casual. "If we're going to convince anyone we're in love, we need to look like we've done this before. Like it's natural."

They practiced standing close, his arm around her shoulders. He was taller than her by several inches—she came up to about his collarbone—and when she leaned into him, he could smell her perfume. Something with amber and paper, fitting.

"Better," he said, though his heart was beating faster than made sense. "Now you."

Astrid slipped her arm around his waist, tentative at first, then with more confidence. They stood there in his apartment, wrapped around each other in an approximation of casual couple intimacy, and Benedict felt the careful professional distance between them compressing into something smaller and more dangerous.

"We should practice kissing," he said, then immediately wanted to take it back.

Astrid stiffened and stepped away. "That's not—we don't need to—"

"Right. No. Forget I said that. Overstepping." He raised his hands in surrender, face burning. "Sorry."

But she was looking at him with an expression he couldn't decode. Fear, yes. But also something else. Curiosity, maybe. Or possibility.

"Let's just... see how things go," she said carefully. "Improvise if necessary. I don't think we need to rehearse that."

"Of course. You're right. Improvisation is fine."

The moment stretched between them, charged with everything they weren't saying. Outside, the Brooklyn afternoon was fading into evening, the light going blue.

Astrid cleared her throat and moved back to the table, gathering her notebook. "I should go. We have dates for the trip—Mrs. Penrose confirmed for three weeks from now. That gives us time to prepare separately, get our stories straight."

"I'll do preliminary cipher analysis. Familiarize myself with Cardano's known methods."

"And I'll finish the initial authentication documentation. Build the provenance case." She slid her notebook into her satchel, very deliberately not looking at him. "This is going to work. We just need to commit to the performance."

"Absolutely. Strictly professional."

"Strictly professional," she echoed.

But when she passed him on her way to the door, there was barely a foot of space between them, and Benedict caught himself noticing details he shouldn't notice: the way her hair had escaped her ponytail to curl at her temples, the gold flecks in her eyes, the fact that she'd bitten her lower lip at some point and it was slightly fuller than the top.

"Benedict?" She'd stopped at the door, turned back. "Thank you. For agreeing to this. I know it's... complicated."

"Thank you for trusting me with it."

"I don't trust easily."

"I know. Which makes it mean something that you're trusting me now."

Astrid smiled—small, uncertain, real. "One week until we leave."

"One week."

She left, and Benedict stood in his apartment listening to her footsteps descend the stairs, the building door open and close four floors below.

The loft felt too empty suddenly, too quiet. He looked around at the evidence of their preparation: her teacup still on the table, his notebook where he'd sketched out cipher preliminary analysis, the careful way they'd built a fictional relationship that felt uncomfortably real.

He picked up the page where Astrid had written their cover story timeline in her precise handwriting. First meeting at the Morgan Library. First date at L'Artusi. First kiss in a thunderstorm outside the Strand.

None of it had happened. All of it felt like memory.

Benedict set the page down and walked to the windows. Outside, Brooklyn was doing its evening transformation—lights coming on, the sky going dark. The first drops of rain hit the glass.

Thunder rumbled in the distance.

He thought about Astrid walking to the subway in the approaching storm. Thought about their fabricated first kiss, the one that had never happened but that he could see with perfect clarity: rain hammering down, crowds pressed under the Strand's awning, the moment of decision before he'd leaned in.

The rain came harder, streaking the windows.

Benedict watched it fall and admitted to himself what he'd been avoiding since the coffee shop three days ago: he was in trouble. Real trouble.

Because the version of himself in their cover story—the one who'd fallen for the brilliant rare book appraiser with the precise mind and guarded heart—didn't feel like fiction at all. It felt like confession.

He was about to spend two weeks in Cornwall pretending to be in love with Astrid Whitlock.

The pretending part, he suspected, was going to be easier than it should be.

Which was exactly the problem.

Outside, the storm rolled over Brooklyn in sheets of rain and distant lightning, and Benedict stood at his windows thinking about thunderstorms and first kisses and the difference between deception and truth.

The difference, he was beginning to suspect, might be smaller than he wanted it to be.

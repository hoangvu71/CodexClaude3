# Book Spine: Kissing the Cryptographer Was Never Part of the Authentication Protocol

## Structure
Arc: Three-act | Acts: [1: 10 ch, 2: 12 ch, 3: 8 ch]

## Story Arc
Beginning: Astrid discovers a potentially explosive manuscript at auction that requires authentication from a reclusive collector who only meets with "committed couples," forcing her into a fake engagement with cryptographer Benedict, who needs access to decode the hidden messages that could rewrite history. | Midpoint: As they successfully infiltrate the collector's estate and begin uncovering dangerous secrets within the manuscript, their fabricated relationship starts feeling uncomfortably real during late-night decoding sessions, until a rival auction house threatens to expose their charade and steal the manuscript. | Resolution: Astrid and Benedict must decide whether to protect the historical truth or their hearts when the manuscript's secrets put them both in danger, forcing them to trust the one thing they can't authenticate—their feelings for each other.

## Threads
1. External Plot: Authenticate the rare manuscript, decode its hidden messages, and outmaneuver rival collectors while maintaining the fake engagement. | 2. Character Arc: Astrid learns to trust her heart as much as her expertise, while Benedict discovers that some connections can't be logically deciphered. | 3. Theme: The value of authenticity in a world built on appraisals, and finding what's real when everything starts as pretense.

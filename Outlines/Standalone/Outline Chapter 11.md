# Chapter 11: Re-Entry

**Transition from Previous**: Back in New York after two weeks away—the flight from London to JFK reversing the journey that started this all. Astrid and Benedict must navigate their new relationship in the real world while dealing with professional obligations.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Establish Act 2 setting, show relationship in normal context, introduce professional complications, set up rival threat escalation

**Scene 1 - Separate Lives**: Benedict returns to his Williamsburg loft after dropping Astrid at her Upper West Side apartment, and the separation feels strange after two weeks of constant proximity. His place is exactly as he left it—books, whiteboards, climbing gear—but he feels like a different person. He texts Astrid: "Back home. Weird being apart after two weeks attached at the hip." Her reply comes quickly: "Very weird. Let me settle in, then dinner tomorrow?" "It's a date. An actual date." "Our first real one." Benedict smiles at his phone like a teenager, then forces himself to deal with reality. He has emails from his department head asking about his research trip, inquiries from colleagues about rumors of a significant Cardano find, and a voice message from his ex-wife Clare asking if they can talk about "the situation." That last one makes his stomach drop—what situation? He calls back, gets voicemail, leaves a message asking her to clarify. Then he opens his laptop and begins writing up his cryptographic analysis. The work absorbs him immediately—documenting the cipher method, the key phrase, the decryption process, the historical significance of the revealed content. Hours pass without notice until his phone rings: Astrid. "Sorry, did we have plans?" he asks, glancing at the clock—nearly midnight. "No, I just..." she pauses. "I couldn't sleep. Kept reaching for you and you weren't there." The admission makes his chest tighten with warmth. "I know what you mean. The bed feels empty." "Is this pathetic? We spent two weeks together under false pretenses, and now I'm already missing you after a few hours?" "If it is, we're both pathetic." He hears her soft laugh. "What are you doing?" "Writing up the cipher analysis. You?" "Authentication report. Very dry documentation of provenance, paper analysis, ink composition. Nothing about fake engagements or falling for the cryptographer." Benedict smiles. "Want company? I could come work at your place. Separate projects, just... together." "Yes," she says immediately. "Please yes."

**Scene 2 - Late Night Working**: Benedict takes the subway to the Upper West Side, arrives at Astrid's apartment building at nearly 1 AM. Her place is smaller than his loft but meticulously organized—floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, a desk covered in neat stacks of papers, vintage book posters framed on the walls. It's exactly what he'd expect from her, and he loves it. They settle on her couch with their laptops, working in comfortable silence interrupted by occasional questions or observations. Astrid reads passages from her report aloud, asking if her descriptions of the cipher are technically accurate. Benedict explains his analysis methodology, and she suggests clearer phrasing for non-specialist readers. It's the collaboration they found in Cornwall, translated to normal life, and it works. Around 3 AM, Astrid falls asleep against his shoulder, laptop sliding off her lap. Benedict catches it, saves her document, and sits there holding her while she sleeps, feeling something profound settle in his chest. This is what he wants—not the intensity of the Cornwall bubble, but this quiet domesticity, working together in the middle of the night because neither of them could stand to be apart. When he finally dozes off, they're tangled together on her couch, laptops forgotten, holding each other through what's left of the night. He wakes to early morning light and Astrid awake, watching him. "Hi," she says softly. "Hi." He brushes hair from her face. "This okay? Me showing up at 1 AM to work on your couch?" "This is perfect." She kisses him, morning-breath and honest, and Benedict thinks maybe they can make this work after all.

**Scene 3 - Professional Complications**: Later that morning, Astrid has to go to Marlowe & Sons to submit her preliminary authentication report. Benedict goes with her, curious to see her workplace and wanting to support her through what he knows will be difficult—facing Jonathan Rhys, who leaked their location to Willoughby. The auction house is impressive—elegant townhouse in Midtown, hushed and expensive, walls lined with rare items. Astrid's colleagues greet her warmly, asking about the trip, excited about the Cardano find. She's professional and careful, explaining that the manuscript is being donated to the British Library, that her full report will be ready within a week. Her supervisor, Eleanor Hartwick, a sharp-eyed woman in her sixties, calls Astrid into her office. Benedict waits in the reception area, flipping through auction catalogs, until he sees Jonathan Rhys—young, handsome, confident in an expensive suit—arrive and do a double-take seeing Benedict. "Can I help you?" Rhys asks, all false charm. "I'm with Astrid. Benedict Shaw." Recognition flashes across Rhys's face. "The cryptographer. I heard she brought in a specialist." His tone suggests he's heard more than that. "Did you also hear how you sabotaged her work by leaking our location to Kensington Rare Books?" Benedict keeps his voice level, but the accusation lands. Rhys's expression hardens. "I have no idea what you're talking about." "Marcus Willoughby mentioned someone from Marlowe & Sons tipped him off. You're her primary competition for partnership. Wasn't hard to figure out." "Careful with those accusations. Astrid's obsession with this manuscript has been noted. Coming back with a donation instead of a sale won't help her partnership case." "She preserved historically invaluable material for public access. That's the job." "The job is making money for the firm. Donations are nice for reputation, but sales pay the bills." Rhys smiles coldly. "Tell Astrid I said welcome back. We've missed her around here."

**Scene 4 - Bad News**: When Astrid emerges from Eleanor's office, her expression is carefully controlled, but Benedict knows her well enough now to see the tension underneath. Outside, walking to a nearby café, she finally lets it show. "They're not happy about the donation. Eleanor made it very clear that partnership decisions are based on bringing in revenue, and while the authentication is impressive, no commission means no boost to my candidacy." Benedict feels anger on her behalf. "You did the right thing. Preserved the manuscript, secured its accessibility—" "I know. And I'd make the same choice again. But it still stings." She's quiet for a moment. "There's something else. Eleanor asked about you. Whether we were involved, whether that affected my professional judgment." "What did you tell her?" "The truth. That we met during the forgery case, worked together on this authentication, and developed a relationship during the process. She asked if Lord Ashford knew we were a couple when he granted access." Astrid meets his eyes. "I said yes. Not the whole truth, but not a lie either. By the time we left Cornwall, we were a couple, and he did know." Benedict nods slowly. "And how did she take it?" "Disapproved. Said mixing personal and professional is always complicated, that I should be careful it doesn't damage my reputation." The weight of judgment, professional and personal, settles over them. Back at Astrid's apartment that evening, they're both subdued. The high of reunion is fading into the reality of consequences—professional pushback, ethical compromises, outside scrutiny of their relationship. "Are you regretting this?" Astrid asks quietly. "Us?" "Never. But I am angry that people are using us against you professionally." "That's on me. I made choices, and choices have consequences." She's matter-of-fact, but Benedict hears the hurt underneath. His phone buzzes—finally, a callback from Clare. He steps into Astrid's kitchen to take it, and his ex-wife's voice is tight with stress. "Benedict, we need to talk about the Cardano manuscript." "How do you know about that?" "It's all over the academic networks. Massive find, major historical significance, your decryption. Congratulations." Her tone says it's anything but. "What's the problem?" "The problem is that some of the families implicated in those revelations have money and influence. I've had calls from colleagues being pressured to discredit the authentication, to suggest it's fraudulent or exaggerated." Benedict's stomach drops. "From whom?" "I don't know exactly. But people are worried, Benedict. This isn't just academic history—you're exposing secrets that powerful people apparently want to stay buried." After he hangs up, Benedict stands in Astrid's kitchen, the weight of what they've uncovered settling heavily. They thought the danger was over when they left Cornwall. But maybe it's just beginning.

**Chapter Arc**: Hopeful reunion → comfortable domesticity → professional complications → recognition of ongoing danger. Act 2 begins with relationship working but external pressures mounting.

**Chapter End**: Late that night, Benedict tells Astrid about Clare's warning. They sit on her couch, the city lights visible through her window, and confront the possibility that their work has made them targets. "Maybe we should pull the publication," Astrid says. "Delay until things settle." "Or maybe we publish quickly, get everything out in the open before anyone can suppress it. Truth in sunlight." They're quiet, holding each other, and outside New York hums on, indifferent to the secrets they're protecting and the threats gathering in the shadows.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Escalating pressure to suppress publication, relationship tested by external stress, deeper investigation into who wants manuscript hidden.

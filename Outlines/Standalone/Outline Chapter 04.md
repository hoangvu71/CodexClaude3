# Chapter 4: Departures and Arrivals

**Transition from Previous**: One week later, Astrid and Benedict prepare to travel to Cornwall. They've maintained minimal contact—professional texts confirming arrangements—but both have thought about their rehearsal more than they'd admit.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Transition to Cornwall setting, introduce travel intimacy, first test of their cover story with strangers, arrival at Lord Ashford's estate

**Scene 1 - JFK Departure**: Astrid meets Benedict at JFK's international terminal on a grey November morning, both carrying carefully packed luggage and the weight of what they're about to perform. She's dressed for travel but still polished—cashmere sweater, tailored coat, leather carry-on—while Benedict looks comfortably rumpled in dark jeans and a navy henley under his jacket, his messenger bag predictably stuffed with books and his laptop. There's a moment of awkwardness when they first see each other, the memory of standing too close in his apartment hanging between them, before Astrid takes charge with her usual efficiency: check-in, security, finding their gate. Benedict follows her lead, and she realizes this is their dynamic—she organizes, he adapts. At the gate, waiting for their flight to Heathrow, Benedict produces two coffee cups from somewhere and hands her one, prepared exactly as she likes it (she'd mentioned her order during their preparation week, offhand, hadn't expected him to remember). The small gesture touches her more than it should. They sit in the anonymous gate area surrounded by other travelers, and Benedict pulls out a book—something dense about Renaissance cryptography—while Astrid reviews her authentication protocols on her tablet. A woman across from them smiles and says, "Traveling together?" and without missing a beat Benedict reaches for Astrid's hand, lacing their fingers together, and says, "Can't keep us apart, apparently." His thumb brushes across her knuckles, casual and intimate, and Astrid manages a smile that she hopes looks genuine. The woman coos appropriately and goes back to her magazine, and Astrid doesn't pull her hand away immediately. Benedict's grip is warm and sure, and she remembers the calluses she'd noticed in the coffee shop. "Climbing?" she asks quietly, and he glances at her, surprised. "How did you—" "Your hands." He looks down at their joined hands, nods. "Bouldering, mostly. Helps me think." Another detail filed away, another piece of the real Benedict Shaw beneath the brilliant cryptographer facade.

**Scene 2 - Transatlantic Flight**: The flight is long and intimate in the way only overnight flights can be, the cabin darkened and quiet, passengers sleeping around them. Astrid has the window seat, Benedict the aisle, and the middle is blessedly empty. They work for the first few hours—Astrid reviewing provenance documentation, Benedict reading about Cardano's known encryption methods—occasionally leaning close to share observations, their voices low. Somewhere over the Atlantic, dinner service finished and lights dimmed, exhaustion catches up with Astrid. She's been anxious about this trip, sleeping poorly all week, and now the combination of white noise and darkness pulls at her. She must doze off, because she wakes to find her head on Benedict's shoulder, his arm around her, and the shock of it brings her fully alert. She starts to pull away with an apology, but he says quietly, "You've been asleep about an hour. Seemed like you needed it." His voice is soft, meant not to disturb other passengers, and she's acutely aware of his warmth, the steady rhythm of his breathing, the fact that this position feels dangerously comfortable. "Sorry," she whispers anyway, sitting up, adjusting her glasses. "I didn't mean to—" "Astrid." He turns to look at her, and in the dim cabin lighting his eyes are very blue. "We're meant to be engaged. Falling asleep on my shoulder is probably expected behavior." He's right, logically, but logic doesn't explain the flutter in her chest or the fact that she wants to lean back into that warmth. Instead she nods, professional again, and says she should try to sleep properly since they'll land early and go straight to Cornwall. Benedict agrees, reclines his seat slightly, and she does the same. The small space between them feels vast and impossible to navigate, until Benedict says, "For verisimilitude," and gently pulls her back against his shoulder. This time Astrid lets herself settle there, telling herself it's just practice, just part of the arrangement, even as she breathes in the scent of him—something clean and cedar-like—and feels herself relax completely for the first time in a week.

**Scene 3 - Cornwall by Car**: They land at Heathrow in grey dawn, collect their rental car—Astrid drives, Benedict navigates—and begin the long journey southwest to Cornwall. England in November is all dramatic skies and bare trees, and as they leave the motorway for smaller roads, the landscape becomes wilder, more remote. They stop at a village café for breakfast, proper English tea and scones, and the elderly proprietor asks how long they've been together. "Four months," Astrid says, which is their agreed story, and the woman says they have that "new love glow" and gives them extra jam. In the car afterward, Benedict laughs—a genuine, delighted sound—and says, "New love glow. We're better at this than I thought." Astrid feels herself smile despite her nerves about what's coming. The closer they get to Lord Ashford's estate, the quieter they both become, the weight of their mission settling back over them. Benedict reviews what they know about Lord Ashford: sixty-eight years old, inherited both title and collection from his father, lost his wife Sarah to cancer five years ago and became increasingly reclusive afterward. "He's lonely," Benedict says quietly, looking out at the Cornish moors rolling past. "That's what the 'committed couples' requirement is really about. He wants to be around people who remind him of what he had." Astrid grips the steering wheel tighter, guilt needling at her. They're about to lie to a grieving man, exploit his loss for their own purposes, even if those purposes are professional. "We could still turn back," Benedict says, reading her expression. "Find another way." But there is no other way, and they both know it. The manuscript is too important, the opportunity too rare. "No," Astrid says. "We keep going."

**Scene 4 - Ashford Hall**: Lord Ashford's estate appears as they round a curve in the coastal road—a sprawling Georgian manor house of grey stone perched above the cliffs, the Atlantic churning dark and restless below. Gardens spread around it, gone wild in places, and outbuildings dot the property. It's magnificent and melancholy, beautiful and isolated. They drive up the long gravel drive, and Astrid's hands are trembling slightly as she parks. Benedict reaches over, covers her hand with his. "Together," he says, and she nods. They're met at the door by the secretary, Mrs. Penrose, a crisp woman in her fifties who welcomes them with professional warmth and shows them into a drawing room that smells of old books and wood smoke. The room is filled with light despite the grey day, windows looking out over the cliff gardens and the sea beyond. Lord Edmund Ashford rises from a chair by the fireplace, and Astrid's first impression is of a man who was probably imposing once but has been worn down by grief. He's tall, white-haired, with kind eyes and a cardigan that's seen better days. "Miss Whitlock," he says, shaking her hand. "And Dr. Shaw. Welcome to Ashford Hall." His accent is old-school upper class, gentle and sincere. He invites them to sit, offers tea, and begins what Astrid realizes is an interview. He asks about their work, their interests, and then—gently but inexorably—about their relationship. How they met, when they knew they were serious, what they love about each other. Astrid feels the rehearsed answers stick in her throat, the guilt stronger now in the presence of this lonely, hopeful man. But Benedict leans forward, takes her hand again, and begins to speak. He tells a version of their cover story that sounds utterly real: the moment at the Morgan Library when he saw her examining a manuscript and couldn't look away, the first conversation that lasted hours, the discovery that someone else understood his particular way of seeing patterns in everything. He talks about her precision, her passion for preservation, the way she sees beauty in old things that others overlook. And as he speaks, looking at her with those blue-grey eyes, Astrid realizes he's not entirely acting. Some of this is true, or could be true, or maybe is becoming true in the speaking of it. Lord Ashford watches them both, and his expression softens. "You remind me of Sarah and myself, when we were young," he says quietly. "That look you give each other when you think the other isn't watching." Astrid's throat tightens with emotion she didn't expect—guilt, yes, but also something tender and real that she can't quite name. "Thank you for having us," she manages. "It's an honor to be here." Lord Ashford nods, smiles. "Let me show you to your room," he says. "You must be exhausted from travel. We'll begin work tomorrow."

**Chapter Arc**: Nervous anticipation → small moments of genuine connection during travel → arrival at estate → successful first deception tainted by guilt and unexpected real feelings. Establishes Cornwall setting, introduces Lord Ashford as sympathetic figure, deepens emotional complexity.

**Chapter End**: Mrs. Penrose leads them upstairs to a beautiful bedroom—one bedroom, one bed, sea view—and Astrid and Benedict exchange a look of dawning realization. Neither had thought to specify separate rooms, and now asking would seem suspicious. After Mrs. Penrose leaves, they stand in the quiet room with their luggage and the enormous four-poster bed between them, the sound of waves crashing against cliffs below. "I'll take the floor," Benedict says. Astrid looks at the bed, the floor, his expression. "Don't be ridiculous. We're adults. We can share." But her heart is pounding as she says it, and from the way Benedict swallows hard, she knows this is going to be more complicated than either of them planned.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: First night sharing a room; beginning manuscript examination the next morning.

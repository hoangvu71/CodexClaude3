# Chapter 9: Pressure and Truth

**Transition from Previous**: The day after Willoughby's visit. Tension is high as they work to finalize authentication while Lord Ashford considers his options.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Escalate external pressure, advance relationship through shared adversity, set up Lord Ashford's decision

**Scene 1 - Willoughby's Return**: Benedict is in the library early, working on final cipher documentation, when Mrs. Penrose announces that Mr. Willoughby has returned with "associates" who would like to view the collection. Lord Ashford, ever courteous, admits them—three people this time, including Willoughby, a gray-haired woman introduced as Dr. Helena Marsh (a competing authenticator), and a younger man who's clearly legal representation. Benedict doesn't like this escalation, the way they're overwhelming Lord Ashford with professional pressure. Willoughby asks pointed questions: Is the authentication complete? What have they determined about the manuscript's value? Has Lord Ashford considered offers? Dr. Marsh, with cutting politeness, suggests that a second authentication might be prudent "given the stakes involved" and questions whether Astrid's firm has the expertise for such a significant find. Benedict sees Astrid's jaw tighten at the professional insult, and he intervenes smoothly: "Miss Whitlock is one of the preeminent Renaissance manuscript specialists in the United States. Her authentication will be thorough and unimpeachable. My own cryptographic analysis has been peer-reviewed at Oxford." Willoughby smiles that predatory smile. "Of course. We simply want Lord Ashford to have all options available. My clients are prepared to offer £750,000 for the manuscript, sight unseen, based on the preliminary reports we've heard." The sum is staggering. Benedict sees Lord Ashford's expression—shock, temptation, uncertainty. That much money could secure the estate's future, fund Sarah's charities for years. "That's a very generous offer," Lord Ashford says slowly. "Perhaps I should consider—" "Lord Ashford," Astrid interrupts, voice tight with controlled emotion, "might we speak privately? All of us?" She includes Benedict with a glance. Lord Ashford excuses them, and they retreat to his study while Willoughby and his team wait with barely concealed impatience.

**Scene 2 - The Choice**: In Lord Ashford's private study, Astrid makes her case with passionate precision. The manuscript belongs in a research library where scholars worldwide can access it, study it, build on its revelations. Private sale means it disappears, becomes another wealthy collector's trophy. "This is your wife's legacy," Astrid says. "Sarah wanted truth accessible, not locked away. This manuscript documents crucial historical events—shouldn't historians be able to study it freely?" Lord Ashford looks torn. "But the money would honor her too. Her charities, her causes—" Benedict speaks up, surprising himself with the intensity of his conviction. "Lord Ashford, I lost my marriage because I was never present for what mattered. I was always chasing the next puzzle, the next achievement, never seeing what was right in front of me. Sarah's legacy isn't about money. It's about what she believed: that truth and knowledge should be shared, that scholarship matters." He's talking about more than the manuscript now, and from Astrid's sharp glance, she knows it. "You and Sarah built something real here—a haven for learning. Don't let someone like Willoughby turn it into a transaction." Lord Ashford is quiet for a long moment, looking at the photograph on his desk: him and Sarah, younger, laughing in these very gardens. "You're right," he says finally. "Sarah would have hated this. The pressure, the money-grubbing. She'd want the truth preserved properly." Relief floods through Benedict. "Then we tell them you're donating to a research library." "I'll draft the paperwork today," Lord Ashford says, straightening with new resolve. "The British Library, I think. Sarah always loved it there." They return to the drawing room together, a united front, and Lord Ashford delivers the news with quiet dignity: the manuscript will be donated to the British Library upon completion of authentication. Willoughby's facade cracks, showing irritation. "That's quite short-sighted, Lord Ashford. My clients could offer significantly more, and private sale would ensure the manuscript's... discretion." "Discretion?" Astrid's voice is sharp. "You mean hiding it away from scholars." "I mean protecting potentially sensitive historical information from sensationalization." Dr. Marsh adds icily. Benedict understands then—they don't just want to buy the manuscript; they want to bury it. Someone with power or reputation to protect has hired them to keep the conspiracy revelations quiet. "Who are your clients?" he asks directly. Willoughby's smile is cold. "Confidential, I'm afraid." "The decision is made," Lord Ashford says firmly, more backbone than Benedict has seen from him. "Please leave my property." Willoughby stands, smooth and threatening. "You may regret this choice. Once academic publication begins, you can't control the narrative or protect anyone's reputation—including your own family's." It's a veiled threat, and Benedict moves closer to Astrid protectively. But Lord Ashford doesn't flinch. "My family has nothing to hide. Good day, Mr. Willoughby."

**Scene 3 - Aftermath and Admission**: After they leave, Lord Ashford is shaken but determined. He calls his solicitor to begin donation paperwork, and Astrid coordinates with the British Library's manuscripts division. Benedict watches her work, sees the triumph in her eyes—this is why she loves her job, this preservation of history. But the danger hasn't passed. Willoughby's parting threat suggested they won't give up easily. That evening, Benedict suggests they complete everything as quickly as possible—finalize the authentication, secure the transfer to the British Library, get the manuscript out of Ashford Hall before anyone can interfere. Astrid agrees, though it means their time here is ending. They work late into the night, writing the final authentication report together, documenting everything they've discovered. The manuscript is genuine, dated approximately 1545-1570, Girolamo Cardano's hand, containing encrypted political intelligence and confessions of extraordinary historical significance. Recommended for immediate preservation and scholarly access. When they finally finish, it's past midnight. The library is quiet, lit only by desk lamps, and they sit back exhausted. "We did it," Astrid says softly. "The manuscript is safe. History is preserved." "You did it," Benedict corrects. "This was your find, your authentication." "Our find. I couldn't have cracked the cipher." She looks at him, and something in her expression has changed—softer, more open. "Benedict, what you said to Lord Ashford, about being present for what matters—did you mean that?" He knows this is the moment to be honest, really honest, about everything. "Yes. I meant it. I've spent the last six months since my divorce telling myself I was fine alone, that relationships were just puzzles I couldn't solve. But being here with you—I've been present in a way I haven't been in years. Seeing what matters." "What matters?" Astrid asks, barely a whisper. "You. This. Whatever is happening between us that's real despite starting as pretense." He sees her eyes fill with tears, her careful control cracking. "I'm scared," she admits. "Of this being real? Or of it not being?" "Both. Either. I don't know how to trust this." Benedict reaches for her hand. "Neither do I. But I think we figure it out together, or we don't figure it out at all."

**Scene 4 - Honesty**: Astrid doesn't pull away from his touch. Instead, she laces their fingers together, studies their joined hands. "I told myself the kiss was a mistake because I was terrified it wasn't. That it meant something I wasn't ready to feel." "And now?" "Now I'm still terrified, but I don't want to pretend anymore. Not with you." Benedict feels hope unfold in his chest, careful and new. "What do we do about Lord Ashford? The engagement story?" Astrid takes a shaky breath. "We tell him the truth. After the manuscript is safely transferred. We explain that we weren't really engaged, that we're sorry for the deception, but that—" "But that somewhere in the pretending, something real happened," Benedict finishes. "Yes." She looks up at him, vulnerable and brave. "Can we do that? Tell him we lied but also tell him this is real now?" "I think honesty is the only way forward." They sit together in the quiet library, holding hands, having just committed to truth after days of deception. It feels like a beginning and an ending at once. When they finally return to their bedroom, exhausted, they get ready for bed without the usual awkwardness. And when Astrid climbs in beside him, she doesn't stay on her side. She curls against his chest, his arms come around her, and they hold each other in the darkness with an honesty their waking selves have finally caught up to. "Benedict?" she murmurs, half-asleep. "Mmm?" "I'm glad it was you. For all of this." He presses a kiss to her hair. "So am I." Outside, the Cornish wind howls against the old house, and the sea crashes on the cliffs, but inside they've found something steady and true.

**Chapter Arc**: External pressure escalates → united front against threat → professional success secured → emotional honesty finally achieved. Major turning point: manuscript saved, relationship acknowledged as real.

**Chapter End**: The next morning, Astrid wakes wrapped around Benedict, both of them fully conscious of it now and not pretending it's accidental. He's already awake, watching her, and when she meets his eyes he smiles—soft, genuine, hers. "Morning," he says. "Morning," she replies, and kisses him gently, deliberately, nothing fake about it. They have hard conversations ahead—with Lord Ashford, with themselves, about what happens when they leave this isolated estate and return to real life. But for now, in this moment, they're honest and together, and that's enough.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Final day at Ashford Hall, manuscript transfer arrangements, preparing to tell Lord Ashford the truth.

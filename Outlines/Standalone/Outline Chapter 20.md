# Chapter 20: Forward Motion

**Transition from Previous**: Astrid applies for the British Library position, and both she and Benedict begin preparing for their London move and shared future.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Show application/interview process, advance planning for shared life, resolve professional arcs, build toward Act 2 conclusion

**Scene 1 - The Interview**: The British Library conducts interviews via video conference first, then invites Astrid to London for an in-person final round. She flies over for a long weekend, nervous and excited. The interview is comprehensive—panel of curators and administrators asking about her authentication methodology, her experience with Renaissance materials, her vision for the position's future. They ask, inevitably, about the Cardano manuscript controversy. Astrid answers honestly: she made a questionable choice to gain access, faced consequences, learned from the experience, but the scholarship itself was sound as evidenced by independent verification. "The mistake was ethical, not professional," she says carefully. "I've worked to rebuild trust and ensure my future work meets the highest standards of integrity." One panelist, Dr. Patricia Whitmore, the head curator, nods thoughtfully. "Lord Ashford spoke very highly of your work and character when he donated the manuscript. He mentioned you showed remarkable integrity in difficult circumstances." So Lord Ashford did advocate for her. Astrid feels gratitude and determination—she won't let him down. The interview ends with them thanking her and saying they'll be in touch within a week. It went well, she thinks, but it's impossible to know. Benedict meets her after the interview, having finished his own meetings at Oxford about the fellowship. They walk along the Thames, cold December wind off the water, talking about the future becoming real. "If you get it—" Benedict starts. "When you get it," Astrid corrects, borrowing his confidence. "When you get it, we should start looking at flats. I contacted a letting agent, got some listings." He shows her properties on his phone—modest one-bedrooms in neighborhoods between the British Library and Oxford, compromise locations that work for both commutes. Looking at potential homes together feels significant and domestic and exactly right.

**Scene 2 - Meeting Lord Ashford**: While in London, Astrid asks to visit Lord Ashford in Cornwall. Benedict comes with her, and the drive west is familiar and strange—retracing their path from months ago, when everything was different. Lord Ashford welcomes them warmly, and Astrid is relieved to see he seems genuinely glad to see them. Over tea in his drawing room, with the winter sea grey and restless outside, they talk about the manuscript—now safely at the British Library, being studied by scholars worldwide—and about the settlement that ended the lawsuit. "The truth survived," Lord Ashford says with satisfaction. "Sarah would have been pleased." Astrid gathers her courage. "Lord Ashford, I want to thank you. For forgiving us, for defending us publicly, and for advocating to the British Library. I know you spoke to them about me." He smiles gently. "You did excellent work under difficult circumstances. I simply told them the truth—that you're a dedicated scholar with integrity who made one questionable choice but learned from it. Everyone deserves a second chance." "I won't waste it," Astrid promises. "I know you won't." Lord Ashford looks at them both, sitting close together on his sofa, clearly a couple now with none of the performed uncertainty of their fake engagement. "I'm glad it worked out. The manuscript, the truth, and you two. Sometimes good things come from complicated beginnings." Before they leave, Lord Ashford gives them a gift: a small 18th century book of love poems, carefully preserved. "For your library," he says. "Every home should have poetry." Astrid tears up thanking him, and in the car driving back to London, she and Benedict are both quiet, processing the grace they've been given—forgiveness and support from a man they deceived.

**Scene 3 - The Offer**: Three days after returning to New York, Astrid gets the call: the British Library is offering her the position. She accepts immediately, joy and relief flooding through her. Benedict spins her around his loft when she tells him, both of them laughing, the future suddenly concrete and real. They have three months to prepare—he needs to finish the semester, she needs to transition out of Marlowe & Sons, both need to find somewhere to live in London. It's daunting and exciting. Astrid gives notice at Marlowe & Sons, and Eleanor is gracious about it. "I'm happy for you," her former supervisor says. "This is a better fit for you than auction work ever was. You care more about preservation than profit, always have." It's true, and Astrid is grateful Eleanor sees it. Her last weeks at the firm are bittersweet—saying goodbye to colleagues, finishing projects, closing a chapter of her career. But she's moving toward something better, and that makes it bearable. Benedict introduces her to his department head, colleagues, friends from his climbing gym. She's being woven into his life as he's been woven into hers, and it feels like building a real foundation—not the hastily constructed fake one from Cornwall, but something solid and lasting.

**Scene 4 - Planning Together**: They spend a weekend apartment hunting in London via virtual tours, video calling with the letting agent. It's hilariously domestic—Astrid critiquing layouts and storage, Benedict focused on light for reading and proximity to parks. They compromise on a two-bedroom in Bloomsbury, halfway between the British Library and Benedict's Oxford commute, with high ceilings, good bookshelves, and yes, windows that open. "Why two bedrooms?" the agent asks. "Office space," Benedict and Astrid say simultaneously, then laugh. They know each other's needs—Astrid wants a proper workspace for her authentication projects and research, Benedict needs room for his whiteboards and coding setup. It's practical and thoughtful, and when they submit their application for the flat, Astrid feels like they're building something real. Back in New York, packing begins—sorting through possessions, deciding what to ship and what to donate. Astrid finds the notebook from their first cover story planning session, pages filled with fabricated history. She shows Benedict. "Should we keep this? Evidence of our criminal mastermind beginnings?" He reads through it, laughing at details they'd invented. "The thunderstorm kiss that never happened until it did. The weekend in Boston we actually took last month." "Life imitating fiction," Astrid says. "Or fiction becoming prophecy," Benedict suggests. They keep the notebook, tucking it into a box labeled "Important Papers," because it's part of their story—the complicated, messy, imperfect beginning that led them here.

**Chapter Arc**: Interview and success → reconciliation with Lord Ashford → job offer and acceptance → practical planning for shared future. Forward momentum toward new life together, professional and personal resolution.

**Chapter End**: Three weeks before their London move, Astrid and Benedict are in her apartment (mostly packed now, boxes everywhere). They're making lists of what still needs to be done, and Astrid says, "We're really doing this. New country, new jobs, living together." "Having second thoughts?" Benedict asks, watching her carefully. "No. Just... awe, I think. Six months ago I was faking an engagement to authenticate a manuscript. Now I'm building a real life with you on another continent." "The best authentication you ever did," Benedict says. "Figuring out what's real between us." Astrid kisses him, surrounded by the chaos of transition, and feels certainty. "Definitely genuine," she confirms. "No question." They spend the evening finishing their packing, planning their future, being together in the beautiful ordinary way they've learned to be. The crisis is behind them. The future is ahead. And between them is something solid and true and worth every risk they took to find it.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Final preparations, goodbyes, the actual move to London.

# Chapter 10: Confessions and Departures

**Transition from Previous**: Final day at Ashford Hall. The authentication is complete, manuscript transfer is being arranged, and Astrid and Benedict must tell Lord Ashford the truth about their fake engagement.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Resolve Act 1 with confession to Lord Ashford, begin manuscript transfer, establish real relationship, transition to Act 2 complications

**Scene 1 - The Confession**: Astrid has been dreading this all morning. She and Benedict sit with Lord Ashford in his study after lunch, ostensibly to finalize paperwork, but really to tell him the truth. She's rehearsed what to say a dozen times, but the words still stick in her throat when she begins: "Lord Ashford, there's something we need to tell you. About our relationship." Lord Ashford sets down his tea, gives them his full attention, and Astrid forces herself to continue. She explains everything—the manuscript discovery, the requirement for committed couples, her desperation to authenticate this career-making find, asking Benedict to pose as her fiancé, the fabricated cover story. With each word, she watches Lord Ashford's expression close off, hurt and disappointment replacing the warmth he's shown them. "So none of it was real?" he asks quietly. "The engagement, your feelings, the stories about how you met—all fabricated?" "Not all of it," Benedict says firmly. "The way we met, our work together—that was real. And what developed between us while we were here—that's real too. We started as a deception, but we fell for each other genuinely." Lord Ashford looks between them, expression unreadable. "How am I meant to believe anything you say now? You've lied to me from the moment you arrived." The accusation hurts because it's true. Astrid feels tears prick her eyes. "You're right. We deceived you, and there's no excuse for that. I wanted this authentication so badly—for my career, for the manuscript's preservation—that I compromised my integrity. I'm deeply sorry." "We both are," Benedict adds. "You've been nothing but kind and generous, and we repaid that with lies. You deserved better." Silence stretches painfully. Lord Ashford stands, walks to the window, looks out at his gardens. "Sarah would have been very disappointed," he says finally, and the words land like a blow. Astrid's throat tightens with genuine remorse—not just at being caught, but at having hurt this lonely, grieving man who opened his home to them. "The authentication is still valid," she says quietly. "The manuscript is genuine, the cipher work is accurate. Whatever you decide about the donation, that research is sound." "Oh, I'll still donate it," Lord Ashford says, turning back. "Sarah's wishes matter more than my hurt feelings. And frankly, the manuscript matters more than either of us. But I'd like you both to leave. Today." Astrid nods, swallowing hard. "Of course. We'll pack immediately."

**Scene 2 - Packing and Aftermath**: In their bedroom—no longer theirs, just a room they've occupied under false pretenses—Astrid and Benedict pack in heavy silence. Astrid feels the weight of shame and failure despite the professional success. She got what she came for, but the cost feels higher than she anticipated. "Are you all right?" Benedict asks, pausing in his packing. "No. I feel terrible. He trusted us, and we lied to his face for nearly two weeks." "We did," Benedict acknowledges. "And we were wrong. But we also saved that manuscript from private sale, secured its preservation, treated it with the respect and care it deserved. The lie was wrong, but the work was good." Astrid knows he's right intellectually, but her emotions are tangled. "I keep thinking about what he said. That Sarah would have been disappointed." Benedict crosses to her, takes her hands. "She probably would have been. But she also would have appreciated that we chose honesty in the end, and that we protected the manuscript's integrity. We're flawed people who made a questionable choice for good reasons. That's just human." She leans into him, takes comfort from his steadiness. "What happens now? With us?" "We go back to New York. We figure out what this is in the real world, without the performance, without the isolation. We see if what started as fake can become something lasting." It sounds terrifying and hopeful in equal measure. Before they leave, Mrs. Penrose finds Astrid and hands her an envelope. "From Lord Ashford. He asked me to give this to you after you'd gone." Astrid opens it in the car as Benedict drives them away from Ashford Hall. Inside is a brief note in elegant handwriting: "Miss Whitlock and Dr. Shaw—I'm hurt by your deception, but I'm not blind. I saw something real developing between you, even if you both fought it. Perhaps the universe brought you together through questionable means for good reasons. The manuscript will go to the British Library as planned. Your authentication work was exemplary, whatever the circumstances of it. I wish you both well in determining what's genuine between you. —E. Ashford. P.S. Sarah always said that love found in books was the best kind. Perhaps she was right." Astrid reads it aloud, and they're both quiet for a long moment. "He knew," Benedict says finally. "At the end, he knew something real was happening." "And he forgave us anyway," Astrid says, feeling tears track down her cheeks—relief, gratitude, grief for what they've left behind.

**Scene 3 - Return to London**: They drive to London in contemplative silence, returning the rental car and checking into a small hotel near Heathrow for the night before their morning flight. The room is impersonal, sterile after the character of Ashford Hall, and Astrid feels disoriented—the bubble of Cornwall is burst, reality is pressing in. Over dinner at a pub near the hotel, they try to figure out logistics. Astrid will complete the authentication report officially, submit it to Marlowe & Sons, coordinate with the British Library on the manuscript transfer. Benedict will write up his cryptographic analysis for academic publication, present the findings at conferences. "We'll need to explain how we got access to the manuscript," Benedict says. "Without mentioning the fake engagement." Astrid grimaces. "We can say Lord Ashford granted access based on my firm's reputation and your cryptographic expertise. Which is partially true. He did grant access, just... under false pretenses about our relationship." "And when people ask about us? If they've seen us together at the estate?" "We tell the truth. That we're together now. That we met professionally and developed a relationship during the authentication work." It's the truth, just not the whole truth. More comfortable lies, but smaller ones. "I hate this," Astrid admits. "The parsing of truth, the careful omissions. I spent my whole career valuing authenticity, and now I'm an expert in deception." Benedict reaches across the table for her hand. "Then we stop. We tell the truth, face whatever professional consequences come, and move forward with integrity." "They could question the authentication's validity if they know we lied about our relationship." "Let them. The science is sound. The manuscript can be independently verified. Our personal deception doesn't change the historical facts." He's right, and Astrid feels something settle in her chest—resolution, maybe, or just exhaustion from carrying the weight of lies.

**Scene 4 - New Beginning**: Back in the hotel room, they prepare for bed with new awkwardness—this is the first time they're sharing a bed by choice, not necessity or pretense. The stakes feel different without the cover story. In the dark, lying side by side, Astrid says quietly, "I'm scared this won't work in real life. That what we had there was just isolation and proximity and playing pretend." "It might not work," Benedict admits. "Long-term relationships are hard, and we barely know each other outside of this intense situation. But I'd like to try. Honestly, without deception, see what we can build." "Dating," Astrid says, testing the word. "Like normal people." "Exactly like normal people. Dinner, museums, terrible movies. Getting to know each other's friends. Meeting each other's families eventually. Mundane and real." It sounds wonderful and terrifying. Astrid rolls toward him, finds his hand in the darkness. "Okay. We try. Honestly." Benedict pulls her closer, and she goes willingly, settling against his chest. "Do you ever think about what our cover story first kiss would have been like? The one in the thunderstorm?" Astrid smiles against his shoulder. "Sometimes." "Should we try it? Reenact it properly, now that we're actually together?" She pulls back enough to see his face in the dim light from the window. "Are you asking to kiss me, Dr. Shaw?" "I am, Miss Whitlock." She leans in, kisses him soft and sweet and real, and feels him smile against her lips. It's nothing like the desperate kiss in Cornwall, or the tentative ones since. This one tastes like possibility and choice and truth. When they pull apart, Benedict says, "Better than a thunderstorm." "Much better," Astrid agrees, and kisses him again, taking her time now, no urgency or pretense or fear. Just two people finding something real in the aftermath of fiction. They fall asleep tangled together, holding on through the uncertainty, and when Astrid wakes in the grey London dawn she feels something she hasn't felt in years: hopeful. Not because the future is certain, but because they're facing it honestly together.

**Chapter Arc**: Confession and consequences → professional resolution despite personal failure → tentative new beginning as real couple → hope despite uncertainty. Act 1 conclusion: mission accomplished but complicated by real feelings and ethical compromises.

**Chapter End**: Morning at Heathrow, waiting for their flight to New York. Benedict brings Astrid coffee the way she likes it, and she leans against him reading the morning papers. They look like any couple traveling together, comfortable and connected, except this is the first morning of their actual relationship, no pretense, no performance. The overhead announcements call their flight, and Astrid thinks about returning to New York, to her job, to reality and whatever comes next. Benedict laces his fingers through hers. "Ready?" She squeezes his hand. "Ready." They board together, leaving Cornwall and Ashford Hall and the manuscript behind, carrying only the authentication report, the decryption data, and the fragile new truth of what they've become to each other. Act 1 complete. Act 2 beginning.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Return to New York, re-entry into normal life, facing professional and personal consequences.

# Chapter 24: Preparations

**Transition from Previous**: Engaged and planning their wedding. Summer approaching, professional milestones being achieved.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Show wedding planning, professional success realized, family integration, building toward conclusion

**Scene 1 - Wedding Planning**: Astrid and Benedict decide on a small September wedding in Cornwall. Lord Ashford is delighted to host them at Ashford Hall—"Full circle," he says warmly, "and this time with complete honesty." They plan something intimate: close friends and family only, ceremony in the cliff gardens, reception in the drawing room. Nothing performative or elaborate, just real and meaningful. Astrid's making lists (naturally), and Benedict teases her about over-organizing what should be relaxed and joyful. "I can't help it," she says. "Planning makes me feel in control." "You don't need to control this. It's already right." But he reviews her lists anyway, adds his own thoughts, and they build the wedding together like they build everything—partnership, compromise, shared vision. Rachel will come from New York, Emma from Edinburgh. Benedict's parents will attend together despite being divorced, which he's nervous about but they promise to be civilized. Mrs. Chen is flying over, thrilled to see Astrid married to "someone worthy." Clare sends congratulations and a gracious decline—she's happy for them but attendance would be awkward for everyone. They appreciate her consideration. "It's going to be perfect," Benedict says one evening, looking over their plans. "How do you know?" "Because it's us. Real and honest and exactly what we want."

**Scene 2 - Professional Milestone**: Astrid is offered the Head of Renaissance Collections position. The promotion comes with increased responsibility, a research budget, and the satisfaction of being recognized for expertise and integrity. She accepts, and Dr. Whitmore pulls her aside afterward. "You've rebuilt your reputation remarkably well," she says. "When we hired you, there were board members skeptical about the Cardano controversy. But you've proven yourself through excellent work and unimpeachable ethics. We made the right choice." It's validation Astrid didn't know she needed—that the fake engagement and its fallout haven't permanently tainted her career, that she can be known for her scholarship rather than her mistakes. That evening she and Benedict celebrate at their favorite pub, and she admits, "I was worried I'd always be 'the appraiser who faked an engagement.' But maybe I get to be more than my worst decision." "You've always been more than that," Benedict says. "Brilliant scholar, dedicated preservationist, person of integrity who learns from mistakes. That's who you are." Astrid feels lighter, freer. The past is the past, informing but not defining her.

**Scene 3 - Family Integration**: Benedict's parents visit London, wanting to meet Astrid properly before the wedding. His father Richard is reserved but kind, his mother Judith warm and immediately welcoming. They take them to dinner, and afterward Judith pulls Astrid aside. "I'm glad he found you," she says. "After Clare, I worried he'd give up on relationships entirely. But you make him happy—I can see it in how he looks at you, talks about you. Thank you for loving my son." It's touching and unexpected. Astrid assures her that Benedict makes her happy too, that they're lucky to have found each other. Later, meeting Benedict's father for coffee, Richard is more direct: "Marriage is work. I didn't do that work well enough, and my marriage ended. Learn from my mistakes. Choose each other daily, communicate even when it's hard, don't let work consume everything." "We're trying to do that," Astrid says. "Benedict's very present, and I'm learning to be." "Good. Then you have a better chance than Judith and I did." It's bittersweet wisdom, and Astrid appreciates the honesty. Astrid's own family is small—no parents, no siblings—but Mrs. Chen has become surrogate family, and Rachel is chosen family. When Rachel visits to help with wedding planning, she and Benedict bond over their shared affection for Astrid. "Take care of her," Rachel tells Benedict. "She acts tough, but she's more vulnerable than she lets on." "I know. I will." "And let her take care of you too. She needs to be needed." "I know that too." Rachel grins. "You're going to be fine. You actually understand her." The integration of their separate lives into shared life continues, and it feels right—creating family not just from blood but from choice and love and commitment.

**Scene 4 - Cardano Publication**: Astrid's comprehensive study of the Cardano manuscript is published: "Truth Encrypted: A Complete Analysis of Girolamo Cardano's Political Cipher Manuscript." The book receives excellent reviews in academic journals and attention in historical media. Scholars praise the thoroughness, the contextualization, the ethical handling of sensitive revelations. "Dr. Whitlock has produced the definitive work on this extraordinary document," one review states. "Her authentication is unimpeachable, her analysis insightful, her prose accessible. This will be the standard reference for generations." The British Library hosts a publication event, and Astrid gives a talk about the manuscript, the authentication process, and the importance of preserving difficult truths. Benedict attends, watching from the audience, and during Q&A someone asks about the threats and lawsuit they faced. "Historical truth isn't always comfortable," Astrid says carefully. "Sometimes powerful interests would prefer certain facts remain hidden. But preservation requires protecting truth even when it's inconvenient or controversial. That's our responsibility as scholars and archivists." The audience applauds, and after the event Benedict finds her, proud and impressed. "You've really come into your own here. This is where you belong—not selling manuscripts to the highest bidder, but preserving them for everyone." Astrid knows he's right. The British Library, London, this career—it all fits better than anything she had in New York. Sometimes you have to lose what you thought you wanted to find what you actually need.

**Chapter Arc**: Wedding planning → professional achievement → family integration → publication success. Rewards and resolutions: career validated, families approving, major work published.

**Chapter End**: That night, in their Bloomsbury flat with Gio purring on the couch and wedding plans scattered across the dining table, Astrid updates her author bio for the book jacket. "Dr. Astrid Whitlock is Head of Renaissance Collections at the British Library, where she specializes in manuscript authentication and preservation. She lives in London with her fiancé and cat." Simple, true, complete. Everything she is now distilled into three sentences that bear no trace of who she was—the woman desperate enough to fake an engagement, willing to compromise ethics for career advancement. She's grown into someone better, someone honest, and she's grateful for the journey even though it was painful. Benedict reads over her shoulder. "Fiancé," he says. "Soon to be husband." "Very soon." She leans back against him. "Are you nervous? About the wedding?" "Not even slightly. About marriage, a little, because it didn't work the first time. But about marrying you specifically? No nerves at all. Just excitement." "Me too," Astrid admits. "I thought I'd be terrified, but I'm just ready. Ready to promise forever, ready to build life together officially, ready to be your wife." "Eight weeks," Benedict says, checking their timeline. "Eight weeks until we're married in Cornwall, full circle from where we started. Poetic, really." "Fitting," Astrid agrees. "All good stories should circle back to their beginning, but transformed." That's what they're doing—returning to Ashford Hall, to the place where they performed love, to make it legally and permanently real.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Final weeks before wedding, last preparations, moving toward ceremony.

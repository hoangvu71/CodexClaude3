# Chapter 2: Encryption and Honesty

**Transition from Previous**: Two days after discovering the manuscript, Astrid has rehearsed her pitch a dozen times but still feels unprepared as she waits for Benedict at a coffee shop.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Introduce Benedict, establish their dynamic, present the fake engagement proposition and his acceptance

**Scene 1 - The Coffee Shop Reunion**: Astrid sits in the back corner of a busy Midtown coffee shop, her second cappuccino going cold as she waits. Benedict Shaw arrives fifteen minutes late, apologetic and slightly disheveled, his dark hair falling over his forehead and his messenger bag slung across a faded Smiths t-shirt under a grey blazer. He's exactly as she remembered from their work together on the Victorian diary forgery case—brilliant, distracted, annoyingly perceptive. He gets coffee, black, and slides into the chair across from her with an easy smile that makes her aware of how rigidly she's sitting. "Astrid Whitlock," he says, his British accent still catching her off guard, "your text was impressively cryptic. 'Need your professional expertise on a sensitive matter.' I'm intrigued." She adjusts her glasses, buying time, and he tilts his head, reading her like she reads manuscripts. His eyes are that particular grey-blue that seems to shift in the light, and she remembers how he'd sat across from her six months ago, taking apart the forged diary's cipher in under two hours while making dry observations about Victorian melodrama. They'd worked well together—too well, maybe, because when the case ended she'd felt oddly disappointed and had deliberately not reached out again. Now here she is, about to ask him to pretend to be engaged to her. She starts with the manuscript, because that's safe territory: the Cardano discovery, the cipher, the historical significance. He leans forward immediately, interested, asking technical questions about the encryption method, the pattern distribution, whether she has photos. She shows him a few images on her phone and watches his expression sharpen into focus, that look he gets when he's seeing something no one else can see.

**Scene 2 - The Proposition**: Only after she's established the manuscript's importance does Astrid explain the obstacle: Lord Ashford's eccentric requirement. She watches Benedict process this information, sees the moment he understands why she's asked him here. "You need a fake fiancé," he says, not a question, and she hears the amusement threading through his voice even as his face stays carefully neutral. "For how long?" She's prepared for this question—spent last night researching. "Authentication requires at least a week on-site, possibly two. Lord Ashford's secretary indicated he expects to meet couples over several days to 'get to know them properly.' We'd need to be convincing." Benedict sits back, running a hand through his hair in that habitual gesture she remembers, making it stand up at odd angles. She can see him thinking, turning it over like a puzzle. "And what do I get out of this arrangement?" Fair question. She's prepared for this too. "Access to the cipher. If it's what I think it is—Cardano's encrypted intelligence from the Italian Wars—decoding it would be a significant academic coup. You could publish, present at conferences, establish yourself as the authority on Renaissance cryptography." His divorce made the academic press six months ago; she knows his ex-wife was the more famous scholar, that he's been trying to build his own reputation separate from her shadow. "Plus," she adds, "I pay standard consulting rates for the decryption work." He's quiet for a long moment, fingers tapping a pattern on his coffee cup—she notices he does this, some unconscious rhythm. Finally he looks up, and there's something in his expression she can't quite read. "When would we start?" Relief floods through her, though she keeps her voice level. "Soon. I need to contact Lord Ashford's secretary with confirmation, then we'd need to prepare—backstory, history, make it believable."

**Scene 3 - Establishing the Rules**: They spend the next hour hammering out logistics, and Astrid feels more in control now that they're dealing with practical details. She pulls out her notebook, creating a list: cover story, timeline, boundaries. Benedict suggests they keep it simple—met during the forgery case, reconnected recently, relationship developed naturally. "Closer to the truth, easier to remember under scrutiny," he says, and she nods, making notes in her precise handwriting. They discuss how long they've been "together" (three months feels believable), whether they're living together (no, too complicated), how he proposed (he didn't yet, they're just "committed" per Lord Ashford's requirement). Benedict is surprisingly practical about the deception, treating it like any other project—variables, parameters, expected outcomes. She appreciates this, his lack of awkwardness, though part of her wonders if she should be slightly offended by how clinically he's approaching fake engagement to her. They establish ground rules: maintain the fiction only when necessary, no actual relationship expectations, end the arrangement once the manuscript is authenticated and decoded. "Strictly professional," Astrid says, and Benedict agrees: "Strictly professional." They shake hands across the table, formal and slightly absurd, and his hand is warm and callused in ways that surprise her—she'd expected academic softness, but his grip suggests he does something physical, climbing maybe, or piano. She pulls back first, clears her throat, and says she'll contact Lord Ashford's secretary tomorrow. Benedict nods, finishes his coffee, and stands to leave. At the door he turns back: "Astrid? This cipher—if it's real, if it's what you think—we might be opening something that people encrypted for very good reasons." His expression is serious, the humor gone, and she feels a chill despite the warm café. "I know," she says. "But it's my job to authenticate truth, whatever that truth is." He nods slowly. "Right then. I'll wait for your call, darling." The endearment is mocking, playful, breaking the tension, and he's gone before she can respond, leaving her alone with her empty cup and the feeling that she's just set something in motion she doesn't entirely understand.

**Chapter Arc**: Nervous anticipation → relief at Benedict's agreement → growing awareness of what they're undertaking. Establishes their chemistry, mutual respect, and the transactional foundation of their fake relationship.

**Chapter End**: Astrid watches Benedict disappear into the Manhattan crowds, then looks down at her notebook where she's written "RULES" and underlined it twice. The word "professional" is circled. She picks up her phone to call Lord Ashford's secretary, and her reflection in the dark screen shows her frowning, uncertain. She makes the call anyway.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Arrangements made with Lord Ashford; Astrid and Benedict must now prepare their cover story in detail before traveling to Cornwall.

## Threads Status (End of Chapter 2)

### Ongoing Threads
- **Manuscript Authentication**: Lord Ashford's access requirement now has potential solution. Status: Astrid and Benedict agreed to pose as committed couple; secretary to be contacted.
- **Astrid's Career Ambition**: Manuscript authentication still key to partnership. Status: path forward identified, execution pending.
- **The Cipher Mystery**: Benedict shows immediate interest in decoding. Status: photos shared with him, full access pending authentication trip.
- **Fake Engagement Arrangement**: Astrid and Benedict agree to pose as committed couple. Status: agreement made, logistics to be planned, cover story to be developed. Ground rules established: strictly professional, ends after authentication.

### Planted Seeds
- **Benedict's Divorce**: Referenced as motivating his need for academic recognition separate from ex-wife. Planted this chapter → Will inform his emotional guardedness in Act 2.
- **Benedict's Warning**: Notes encrypted information might be dangerous. Planted this chapter → Payoff when manuscript reveals conspiracy in Chapters 16-17.
- **The Handshake**: Physical contact (handshake) noted as surprising—warm, callused hands. Planted this chapter → Building awareness of physical attraction that will complicate "professional" arrangement.
- **"Darling" Endearment**: Benedict's playful use of relationship term. Planted this chapter → Will become genuine as feelings develop.

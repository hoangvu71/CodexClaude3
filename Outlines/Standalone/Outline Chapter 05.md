# Chapter 5: First Night, First Pages

**Transition from Previous**: Evening at Ashford Hall. Astrid and Benedict must navigate sharing a bedroom for the first time while maintaining their composure.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Show escalating intimacy through shared space, begin manuscript work, deepen both the deception and genuine connection

**Scene 1 - Bedroom Negotiations**: Benedict stands by the window looking out at the darkening sea while Astrid unpacks with determined efficiency, both of them carefully not discussing the bed situation. The room is beautiful—high ceilings, antique furniture, thick carpets—and the bed is genuinely massive, an old four-poster that could probably sleep four people comfortably, which should make this easier but somehow doesn't. They navigate around each other like polite strangers, establishing territories: Astrid takes the attached bathroom first, emerges in flannel pajamas that are somehow both modest and distracting, her hair down from its usual style and falling past her shoulders in auburn waves he's never seen before. Benedict takes his turn, brushes his teeth while staring at his reflection and trying to approach this logically—they're both exhausted, the bed is large, this is purely practical. When he emerges in t-shirt and sleep pants, Astrid is already under the covers on the left side, reading on her tablet, her glasses catching the bedside lamp light. He takes the right side, maintains careful distance, turns off his lamp. The darkness makes it worse somehow, more intimate. He can hear her breathing, the rustle of sheets as she shifts. "This is fine," Astrid says into the darkness, too brightly. "Completely normal." "Absolutely," Benedict agrees, lying rigid as a board, staring at the ceiling. A long silence, then: "Your feet are cold," Astrid says. "Sorry." He pulls them back from where they'd apparently drifted toward the middle. More silence. The unfamiliarity of another person in his bed—it's been six months since the divorce, and even before that Clare often slept in her office—is both unsettling and unexpectedly comforting. Finally exhaustion wins, and Benedict feels himself relaxing into sleep, the sound of waves below the window and Astrid's quiet presence lulling him under. He wakes once in the deep night to find they've both migrated toward the center, Astrid's back against his chest, his arm over her waist, and the rightness of it terrifies him before sleep pulls him back down.

**Scene 2 - Morning at Ashford Hall**: Benedict wakes to grey dawn light and the realization that Astrid is already up, standing by the window in jeans and a cream sweater, her hair in a braid, looking out at the wild Cornish coast. He watches her for a moment before she notices he's awake, sees the tension in her shoulders, and wonders if she's remembering the same thing he is—waking up wrapped around each other, the terrible comfort of it. She turns, catches him looking, and there's a beat of acknowledgment before they both retreat into normalcy. "Morning," she says. "Sleep well?" "Well enough," he lies, and goes to shower. Breakfast is served in a sunny morning room overlooking the gardens: proper English breakfast with Lord Ashford as host. He's more animated this morning, telling them stories about the estate, his late wife's love of the gardens, his father's obsessive collecting. Benedict watches Astrid charm him gently—asking about Sarah, admiring family photos on the sideboard, showing genuine interest in the history. She's good at this, he realizes, connecting with people when she lets herself. When Lord Ashford asks about their plans for the day, Astrid explains her authentication process: she'll need to examine the manuscript thoroughly, document its physical properties, photograph key pages, compare it to known exemplars if Lord Ashford has any in his collection. "And I'll begin preliminary analysis of the cipher," Benedict adds. "Though full decryption will take time." Lord Ashford nods, eager. "I've always wondered what it contained. Father acquired it in 1952, never had it properly analyzed. Just catalogued it as 'Cardano medical notes' and added it to the collection." Medical notes. Benedict catches Astrid's eye—if it were only medical notes, why encrypt them? They're on the trail of something more.

**Scene 3 - The Library**: Lord Ashford's private library is everything Benedict dreamed it would be and Astrid clearly hoped for—a two-story room lined floor to ceiling with books, rare manuscripts in climate-controlled cases, a scholar's paradise. Lord Ashford handles the Cardano manuscript with careful reverence, placing it on a reading table prepared with proper supports and lighting. The moment Astrid bends over it, her entire demeanor changes—this is her element, her expertise. She works with intense focus, examining binding, paper quality, ink, watermarks, making detailed notes. Benedict photographs pages systematically, his academic training kicking in, but part of his attention is on watching Astrid work. She's beautiful like this, completely absorbed, occasionally murmuring observations to herself. Lord Ashford watches them both with a small smile, then excuses himself—"I'll leave you to your work. Mrs. Penrose will bring tea at eleven"—and suddenly they're alone with the manuscript and the enormity of what they're seeking. Astrid looks up, meets Benedict's eyes. "It's genuine," she says quietly. "Late 1540s, Cardano's hand, consistent with his known works. The paper, the ink, the binding—all period appropriate." "And the cipher?" She turns pages carefully, showing him blocks of encrypted text interspersed with Italian medical observations. "More extensive than the photographs suggested. Look—it's not random distribution. The encrypted sections follow specific topics in the medical text." Benedict leans close, shoulder touching hers, and begins to see the pattern. The cipher appears after discussions of specific patients, high-ranking ones if he's reading the titles correctly. Nobility. Church officials. Political figures. "He was their physician," Benedict says slowly. "And he encrypted what he learned from them. Confessions, secrets, intelligence." "Things dangerous enough to hide," Astrid agrees. Their eyes meet over the centuries-old manuscript, and Benedict feels the thrill of discovery arc between them. This is why he became a cryptographer—this moment of standing at the edge of hidden truth. But he's also acutely aware of Astrid's proximity, the gold flecks in her hazel eyes, the fact that this shared passion is part of what makes their fabricated story feel so real.

**Scene 4 - Afternoon Progress**: They work through the morning and into the afternoon, falling into an easy collaboration. Astrid handles the manuscript with expert care, reading aloud the Italian medical text, providing historical context. Benedict begins breaking down the cipher—it's polyalphabetic, sophisticated for its era, possibly a variant of the Bellaso cipher that was being developed around that period. He fills pages with frequency analysis, pattern recognition, muttering to himself the way he always does when deep in problem-solving. At some point Mrs. Penrose brings tea and sandwiches, and they eat without stopping work, too absorbed to notice the time passing. "Here," Astrid says, pointing to a passage. "He's discussing a Cardinal Bellini—I think that's Cardinal Giovanni Bellini, he was involved in the Italian Wars, advisor to the Pope. The medical notes are vague, but then..." She indicates the cipher block that follows. Benedict leans in, studies it. "If I'm right about the key pattern, this might be documenting political intelligence Bellini shared during treatment. Troop movements, maybe, or diplomatic negotiations." "Dangerous information," Astrid says. "The kind that gets people killed if it falls into the wrong hands." They look at each other, and Benedict thinks about his warning in the coffee shop—that they might be opening something encrypted for good reason. But they're committed now, too deep to turn back. The light is fading when Lord Ashford returns, asking about their progress. Astrid gives him a careful summary: manuscript is authentic, cipher is complex but solvable, contents appear to be sensitive historical information. Lord Ashford looks thoughtful. "And if it contains something... controversial? Damaging?" "Then it's still history," Astrid says firmly. "Truth doesn't stop being true because it's uncomfortable." Lord Ashford nods slowly. "Sarah always said the same thing. She was a historian, you know. Believed in preserving truth above comfort." His expression is sad but approving, and Benedict feels the guilt again—they're deceiving a man who values truth, while uncovering truths he encrypted. The irony isn't lost on him.

**Chapter Arc**: Awkward intimacy → professional collaboration → intellectual excitement of discovery → growing guilt about deception. Establishes the manuscript work that will occupy them, shows their natural compatibility, deepens both the fake and real relationship.

**Chapter End**: Evening, back in their shared room. They change for dinner in careful privacy, and as Astrid emerges from the bathroom in a simple black dress, hair loose, Benedict realizes he's staring. She catches him looking, something flickers in her expression—question, maybe, or recognition—and she says quietly, "We should be careful." "Careful?" "Lord Ashford is already convinced. We don't need to..." she trails off, gestures vaguely between them. "We don't need to make this more complicated than it is." Benedict nods, understanding. She's drawing a line, reminding them both that this is professional, temporary, fake. "Right," he says. "Strictly professional." But as they go down to dinner, his hand finds the small of her back automatically, and she doesn't pull away, and they both know the line is already blurring beyond recognition.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Settling into routine at the estate, deeper manuscript work, social dinner with Lord Ashford that requires more performance.

## Threads Status (End of Chapter 5)

### Ongoing Threads
- **Manuscript Authentication**: Confirmed genuine, late 1540s Cardano work. Status: documentation underway.
- **The Cipher Mystery**: Identified as polyalphabetic cipher, likely documenting political intelligence from high-ranking patients. Status: Benedict beginning decryption, pattern analysis started. Cardinal Bellini reference noted.
- **Fake Engagement Arrangement**: Successfully maintaining fiction with Lord Ashford. Status: increasingly complicated by shared bedroom, physical proximity, intellectual compatibility. Both aware of blurring lines but trying to maintain boundaries.
- **Astrid's Career Ambition**: Authentication proceeding perfectly. Status: success in reach.

### Planted Seeds
- **Waking Up Together**: They migrated toward each other during sleep, woke up cuddled. Planted this chapter → Payoff as they stop fighting the attraction in Chapter 7-8.
- **Cardinal Bellini's Intelligence**: First specific cipher content identified. Planted this chapter → Will connect to larger conspiracy in Chapters 16-17.
- **Sarah Was a Historian**: Lord Ashford's late wife valued truth above comfort. Planted this chapter → Will inform final decision to publish manuscript honestly in Act 3.
- **"We should be careful"**: Astrid tries to enforce boundaries. Planted this chapter → Boundaries will fail as feelings intensify.
- **Benedict Staring**: Physical attraction becoming harder to ignore. Planted this chapter → Building sexual tension for later chapters.
- **Medical Notes Cover**: Manuscript catalogued incorrectly as simple medical notes. Planted this chapter → Someone may have wanted contents hidden/overlooked.

### Resolved Threads
- **Manuscript Authenticity Question**: Resolved this chapter. Confirmed genuine Cardano work from 1540s.

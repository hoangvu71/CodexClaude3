# Chapter 16: Public Battle

**Transition from Previous**: The forgery lawsuit is public. Astrid and Benedict must manage media response while preparing their legal defense.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Show public court of opinion, reveal more dangerous content from manuscript, demonstrate growing public support, advance legal strategy

**Scene 1 - Media Firestorm**: The lawsuit dominates headlines in academic and historical circles. "Scholars Accused of Renaissance Forgery Scheme" and "Cardano Manuscript Authenticity Challenged" appear across media outlets. Astrid forces herself to read the coverage—some is sympathetic, portraying them as scholars under attack for revealing inconvenient truths, but other outlets present it as legitimate questions about authentication methodology and conflicts of interest. The fake engagement gets dredged up repeatedly, framed as evidence of their willingness to deceive. Comments sections are vicious. Astrid makes herself stop reading after encountering the twentieth variation of "sleeping her way to authentication." Benedict, seeing her distress, physically removes her laptop. "Stop torturing yourself. We have lawyers and experts handling this. You don't need to read anonymous internet cruelty." "I need to know what we're facing." "You already know. We're facing powerful people using every weapon they have to discredit us. Reading strangers' opinions won't change our strategy." He's right, but Astrid can't help cataloging the damage to her professional reputation. Even if they win the lawsuit, even if the authentication is vindicated, she'll always be the appraiser who faked an engagement to access a manuscript. The stain won't wash clean. Rachel advises them to do selective media appearances—thoughtful, measured interviews that emphasize the historical importance of the manuscript and the unprecedented nature of the legal attack on scholars. Astrid gives an interview to the BBC where she explains the authentication process in detail, walks through the evidence of genuineness, and carefully notes that powerful families with historical secrets they'd prefer hidden are behind the forgery accusation. The interviewer asks about the fake engagement. Astrid has prepared for this, practiced with Benedict, but it still hurts to answer honestly. "I made a questionable decision to gain access to Lord Ashford's collection. I've apologized to him directly, faced professional consequences, and learned from that mistake. But my personal error doesn't change the scientific validity of my work. The manuscript is genuine regardless of how I obtained access to authenticate it."

**Scene 2 - Dangerous Revelations**: As the lawsuit proceeds, Astrid and Benedict decide to release more of the manuscript's contents—if they're being accused of forgery anyway, might as well make clear why certain parties want the revelations suppressed. Benedict writes a detailed article for a popular history magazine explaining the assassination plot against Elizabeth I, naming the historical figures involved, including the Cavendish-Moreton ancestor who escaped punishment despite evidence of complicity. He documents the papal financial corruption, the Medici assassination plots, all the dangerous secrets Cardano encrypted. The article goes viral. Historians are fascinated, the public is intrigued, and most importantly, the motivations of the lawsuit plaintiffs become transparently obvious. "They're suing to protect their ancestors' reputations," one prominent historian tweets. "This isn't about forgery—it's about powerful families trying to bury embarrassing history." Public opinion begins to shift. Academic freedom organizations issue statements supporting Astrid and Benedict's right to publish historical findings without legal harassment. The British Library releases a statement affirming the manuscript's authenticity based on their independent examination. Lord Ashford gives an interview to The Guardian explaining his family's possession of the manuscript, his decision to donate it for scholarly access, and his outrage that the plaintiffs are trying to suppress historical truth for vanity. "My late wife Sarah believed history belongs to everyone," he says. "These families are trying to make it their private property to manipulate as they please. I won't stand for it." Astrid watches the interview with tears in her eyes. Lord Ashford is defending them publicly despite the fake engagement, despite their deception. Benedict puts his arm around her. "He forgave us. Really forgave us. He's on our side." "We don't deserve him," Astrid says. "Maybe not. But we have him anyway."

**Scene 3 - Legal Maneuvering**: Rachel calls with mixed news. The plaintiffs' legal team is aggressive and well-resourced, but their case is weak on facts. "They're relying on attacking your credibility rather than proving forgery," she explains. "Because they can't prove forgery—the manuscript is genuine. So they focus on your relationship, the circumstances of authentication, claiming bias and deception undermine your professional judgment." "Can they win on that?" Benedict asks. "Unlikely, but they can drag it out and damage you in the process. Which is why we're filing a motion to dismiss for lack of evidence. Make them produce actual proof of forgery or drop the case." The motion to dismiss is filed, and now they wait for the court's decision. Meanwhile, Rachel advises them to provide depositions—sworn testimony about the authentication process, the manuscript's provenance, their professional qualifications. The depositions are grueling. Astrid sits in a conference room for eight hours being questioned by hostile lawyers about every aspect of her work. They ask about her relationship with Benedict, when it started, whether Lord Ashford knew, implying she seduced her way into Ashford Hall. They question her expertise, her methodology, her motivation. She answers carefully, sticking to facts, refusing to be provoked. "I authenticated the manuscript using standard scientific methods: paper analysis, ink composition, handwriting comparison, provenance documentation, historical context. My personal life is irrelevant to those objective findings." But it's exhausting defending herself against insinuations and attacks disguised as questions. Benedict's deposition is similarly brutal. That night in the hotel room, they're both wrung out and angry.

**Scene 4 - Turning Point**: Just when the legal battle feels endless, James Cavendish contacts them again. "The board is fracturing," he tells them via encrypted message. "The publicity is worse than they anticipated. Several members want to withdraw from the lawsuit before it does more damage. My family's reputation is suffering—we look like vindictive aristocrats trying to hide our ancestor's treason. The Vatican fund is worried about optics. Only the Medici Foundation is still pushing hard." "What does that mean for us?" Astrid asks. "It means if you push hard now, they might settle. Withdraw the lawsuit in exchange for both sides agreeing not to pursue further legal action." "We'd have to drop harassment charges," Benedict realizes. "Is that worth it?" Astrid thinks about what they want: the manuscript authenticated and accessible, the truth public, their reputations restored. The lawsuit withdrawal would accomplish most of that. Pursuing harassment charges would mean more litigation, more stress, more years of fighting. "I just want this to end," she admits. "I want our lives back." They discuss with Rachel, who thinks settlement is a good outcome. "You keep your reputations, the manuscript stays at the British Library, the truth is public. They withdraw all accusations of forgery. That's a win." Negotiations begin through lawyers. Astrid and Benedict wait in their hotel room—which has become home in a strange way, this bland temporary space where they've fought and feared and loved each other through the worst crisis either has faced. "When this is over," Astrid says, "I want to live somewhere with windows that actually open. And maybe a cat." Benedict smiles. "Specific requirements." "I'm tired of temporary. I want permanence. Roots. Home." She looks at him. "With you, if you want." "I want," Benedict says simply. "My loft, your apartment, somewhere new—I don't care where as long as you're there." They're making plans for a future that feels tantalizingly close now, beyond the legal battle, beyond the threats. A real life together, built on truth this time.

**Chapter Arc**: Media battle → strategic revelation of dangerous content → public opinion shifting → legal maneuvering → settlement possibility emerging. Turning from defensive to winning position.

**Chapter End**: Rachel calls. "They're offering settlement. Full withdrawal of forgery accusations, public statement acknowledging the manuscript's authenticity, agreement that both sides bear their own legal costs and pursue no further claims. It's over if you accept." Astrid looks at Benedict. This is what they've been fighting for—vindication, the truth protected, their freedom restored. "We accept," she says. The relief is overwhelming. Benedict pulls her into a fierce hug, and Astrid feels tears tracking down her face—release, exhaustion, joy. They did it. They fought powerful interests and won. The truth survived.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Settlement finalized, returning to normal life, processing what they've been through, relationship adjusting to peace after crisis.

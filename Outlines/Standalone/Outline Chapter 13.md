# Chapter 13: Exposure

**Transition from Previous**: Hours after publishing their work. The academic world is responding, but so are the people who wanted it suppressed.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Show public response to publication, escalate threats to physical danger, force them to seek protection, deepen their reliance on each other

**Scene 1 - Initial Response**: Benedict wakes on Astrid's couch to his phone exploding with notifications. Their publications went live overnight, and the academic community is reacting with a mixture of excitement, skepticism, and intense interest. Emails from colleagues, interview requests from historical journals, invitations to present at conferences. His department head calls, thrilled about the publicity for the university, already talking about research grants and speaking opportunities. It's everything Benedict hoped for professionally—recognition, validation, establishing himself as a leading Renaissance cryptography expert separate from Clare's shadow. But threaded through the congratulations are other messages. Anonymous emails calling him a fraud. Comments on the pre-print server questioning his methodology. A colleague mentioning that someone contacted him asking about Benedict's "reliability and academic rigor." The campaign to discredit him is already underway. Astrid emerges from her bedroom, also checking her phone, expression tense. "The British Library confirmed receipt of the manuscript from Lord Ashford. It's in their secure collection now." "That's good. They can't steal it back." "No, but they can still destroy our reputations." She shows him a blog post from an "anonymous Renaissance specialist" tearing apart her authentication methodology, suggesting she's inexperienced and her judgment was compromised by "personal entanglements." It's professional character assassination, and Benedict sees the hurt in her eyes.

**Scene 2 - Media Attention**: By afternoon, the story has broken into mainstream media. "Hidden Renaissance Secrets Revealed" and "Conspiracy Against Elizabeth I Exposed" headlines appear in history-focused outlets. A BBC history program contacts Benedict for an interview. The New York Times wants to speak with Astrid about the authentication and preservation process. It's overwhelming and exciting, but Benedict can't shake unease. The more public this becomes, the more pressure on whoever wants it suppressed. He's proven right when Astrid gets a call from Eleanor at Marlowe & Sons. From Astrid's side of the conversation—tense, defensive—Benedict gathers it's not going well. When she hangs up, she's pale. "They're suspending me pending review. Eleanor said the media attention is 'problematic' and there are questions about my methodology and ethics. Someone sent the firm an anonymous dossier detailing our 'deception' of Lord Ashford, claiming I fabricated our relationship to gain access to the manuscript." Benedict feels cold fury. "They're exposing the fake engagement." "Selectively. Making it sound like I seduced you to help me con a vulnerable elderly man, when the reality was much more complicated." Her voice shakes. "My career is over. Partnership is gone. I might lose my job entirely." Benedict pulls her close, feeling her trembling against him. "We fight this. We explain the full context, show that the authentication is sound regardless of how we obtained access—" "Benedict, someone sent them documentation. Photos of us at Ashford Hall, copies of our communication, timeline showing we 'suddenly' became a couple right before the trip. They've built a narrative of calculated deception." "Then we build our own narrative. The truth."

**Scene 3 - Threatening Escalation**: That evening, things get worse. Benedict returns to his loft to grab clothes and work materials, planning to stay at Astrid's for mutual support, and finds his apartment has been broken into. Nothing obviously stolen, but things have been moved, searched. His laptop is missing—not the one with his main work (he has that with him) but his backup that had personal files, correspondence. And on his whiteboard, someone has written in red marker: "Stop now. This is your last warning." Benedict calls the police, files a report, but he's shaken. This isn't just professional intimidation anymore; someone broke into his home, went through his things, left a direct threat. The violation feels personal and frightening. He calls Astrid immediately, tells her what happened. "Come here," she says. "Right now. Don't go back there alone." At her apartment, they're both rattled. The break-in makes the danger concrete. Whoever is behind this has resources, determination, and no qualms about criminal activity. "We should go to the police with everything," Astrid says. "The emails, the bribe attempt, the break-in." "And tell them what? That powerful families are upset about historical revelations? There's no specific crime except the break-in, and that could be random." He knows he sounds defeatist. "It wasn't random, and you know it." Astrid is pacing now, agitated. "They're escalating because we published. Dr. Marsh warned us there would be 'other measures.'" Benedict's phone buzzes—email from an unknown sender. Subject: "Photographs." Inside are images: him and Astrid at Heathrow, at her apartment building, at the coffee shop yesterday. They're being followed, surveilled, documented. The message is clear: we know where you are, we can get to you anytime. "That's it," Benedict says, decision made. "We're going somewhere safe. Tonight."

**Scene 4 - Seeking Sanctuary**: They throw essentials into bags and take a cab to a hotel in a different neighborhood—somewhere anonymous, paid in cash, registered under a fake name. It feels paranoid and necessary in equal measure. In the bland hotel room, door locked and chained, they finally breathe. "This is insane," Astrid says, sitting on the edge of the bed. "We're hiding in a hotel because we published historical research." "We're hiding because we exposed powerful people's secrets, and they're willing to threaten us to keep them buried." Benedict sits beside her, takes her hand. "I'm sorry. This is partly my fault—I pushed for immediate publication." "I agreed. We both chose truth over safety." She leans against him, exhausted. "But I'm scared, Benedict. Really scared." "Me too." He wraps his arms around her, and they hold each other in the anonymous room, seeking comfort. "What do we do now?" "We figure out exactly who's behind this, get concrete evidence, go public with the intimidation. Sunlight is the best disinfectant—if we expose their tactics, they lose power." Astrid nods against his shoulder. "And in the meantime?" "We stay together, stay safe, and keep fighting. We've come too far to back down now." They spend the night in the hotel, taking turns sleeping while the other stays alert, jumping at every noise in the hallway. It's a far cry from the comfortable domesticity of a few days ago, but Benedict realizes something: the danger has stripped away any remaining pretense between them. This is real, this relationship, tested under the worst circumstances and holding strong. When Astrid finally falls into exhausted sleep, Benedict stays awake watching her, cataloging everything he's come to know—the way she pushes her hair back when she's thinking, the precise way she makes lists, the fierce intelligence and integrity that brought them here. He's falling in love with her, probably already has fallen, and that realization in this moment of danger is both terrible and perfect.

**Chapter Arc**: Professional triumph → public exposure of their deception → escalation to physical threat and surveillance → going into hiding together. Act 2 complications intensifying: careers damaged, safety threatened, forced into isolation again.

**Chapter End**: Morning in the hotel room. Astrid wakes to find Benedict at the window, watching the street below. "Anything?" she asks. "No. Either they don't know we're here, or they're waiting." He turns to her, and his expression is serious. "Astrid, I need to tell you something. In case this gets worse, in case we don't have another chance—" "Don't," she interrupts. "Don't say goodbye before we have to." "It's not goodbye. It's hello. It's me saying that whatever happens, I don't regret any of this. Meeting you, working with you, falling for you. Even the fake engagement that started it all. I'd do it again." Astrid crosses to him, frames his face with her hands. "I love you," she says simply. "I didn't want to, fought it as long as I could, but I do. I love you." Benedict kisses her, tender and fierce, and for a moment the danger recedes. They have this, each other, and the truth they've protected. Whatever comes next, they face it together.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Investigation into who's threatening them, attempting to build evidence, relationship deepening under extreme pressure.

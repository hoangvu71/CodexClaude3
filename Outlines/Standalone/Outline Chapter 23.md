# Chapter 23: Milestones

**Transition from Previous**: Six months into London life. Spring has arrived, and Astrid and Benedict are thriving personally and professionally.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Show professional success, introduce engagement consideration, deepen domestic contentment, build toward final act resolution

**Scene 1 - Professional Achievement**: Benedict's research is going extraordinarily well. He's writing a book on Renaissance cryptography, building on his Cardano work, and his Oxford supervisor is thrilled with his progress. He presents at a conference in Cambridge, and Astrid comes to watch. Seeing her in the audience, listening to him explain his decryption methodology, fills him with pride and gratitude. She understands his work, values it, and her presence grounds him. Afterward, colleagues congratulate him, and several mention the Cardano manuscript—it's become his defining work, the project that established his reputation. One professor asks about future research, and Benedict finds himself talking about working with the British Library on their cryptographic collections, possibly collaborating with Astrid on authentication projects. The idea excites him—more partnership, combining their expertise, building something together professionally as well as personally. On the train back to London, Astrid reads through his draft book chapters, offering comments and catching historical context he'd missed. "You should be a co-author," Benedict says. "You've contributed so much." "This is your work. I'm just supporting it." But she's glowing at being included, and Benedict loves her input, the way she makes everything better.

**Scene 2 - The Ring**: Benedict has been thinking about marriage for weeks. Not the fake engagement they performed in Cornwall, but the real thing—asking Astrid to marry him, building a legal and emotional commitment. He's nervous about it, though. They started with lies, and he wants to make sure she's ready for something as permanent as marriage. He discusses it with Emma over video call. "You're overthinking," his sister says bluntly. "You live together, you're happy, you've committed to a life together. The ring is just making it official." "But what if she's not ready? We've only been together about a year, and so much of that was crisis and adjustment." "Benedict. Have you seen the way she looks at you? She's ready. The question is whether you are." Is he? Marriage failed once before, badly. But that was different—he and Clare were wrong for each other despite their compatibility on paper. Astrid is different. She makes him want to be present, to build a home, to choose partnership over solitude. Yes, he's ready. He buys a ring—simple, elegant, an emerald because she mentioned once preferring colored stones to diamonds. It's not showy but it's perfect for her, and he carries it in his pocket for days, waiting for the right moment.

**Scene 3 - Astrid's Project**: Astrid's comprehensive study of the Cardano manuscript is nearly complete. She's spent months analyzing every aspect—the encryption, the historical context, the political implications, the people mentioned. It's the most thorough authentication and analysis anyone has ever done on the document, and it will be published by a major academic press. Dr. Whitmore calls her into the office to discuss publication timeline and to mention something else: the British Library is creating a new senior position—Head of Renaissance Collections—and they want Astrid to apply. "You've proven yourself exceptional in six months," Dr. Whitmore says. "The board is impressed with your scholarship, your attention to detail, your ability to attract attention to our collections. This promotion would mean more responsibility, better compensation, leadership opportunities." It's everything Astrid worked toward at Marlowe & Sons—recognition, advancement, professional validation—but this time earned through scholarship rather than sales, through integrity rather than competition. She accepts the application, and that evening tells Benedict over dinner. He's thrilled for her, insists on celebrating with expensive wine and takeout from their favorite Indian place. "Head of Renaissance Collections," he says, toasting her. "You're brilliant." "Not yet. Have to get the position first." "You will." His certainty steadies her. They've learned to believe in each other's success, to support without competition or jealousy. It's partnership in the truest sense.

**Scene 4 - Perfect Moment**: The next weekend, they take a day trip to Cornwall. It's been months since they saw Lord Ashford, and they wanted to visit. The drive west is nostalgic—passing landmarks from their first trip, remembering who they were then versus who they are now. Lord Ashford is delighted to see them, commenting on how settled and happy they look. They walk the cliff gardens together, and Astrid tells him about the Cardano project nearing completion. "Sarah would have loved to read it," Lord Ashford says wistfully. "She'd have been pleased you're the one to write it." After tea, Benedict asks Lord Ashford privately for a moment. "I want to ask Astrid to marry me. Properly this time, not as a charade. And I wanted you to know, and to ask for your blessing—I know that's old-fashioned, but you're important to both of us." Lord Ashford's eyes water slightly. "My boy, you have my blessing and my joy. You two have become what I hoped you were pretending to be. It's a gift to see love flourish despite difficult beginnings." "Thank you for forgiving us. For supporting us. We wouldn't be here without your grace." "And I wouldn't have seen the manuscript preserved and published without your courage. We've all been fortunate." That evening, Benedict and Astrid walk the clifftops at sunset—the same path where they almost confessed feelings months ago, where the wind and the sea witnessed the beginning of something real. "Astrid," Benedict says, stopping at the viewpoint. "What?" She turns to him, and he drops to one knee, pulling out the ring. Her hands fly to her mouth, eyes wide. "I know we started with a fake engagement," Benedict says. "But I want the real thing. I want to marry you, build a life with you, be your partner in everything. Will you—" "Yes," Astrid interrupts, laughing and crying. "Yes, absolutely yes." He slides the ring on her finger—it fits perfectly—and stands to kiss her while the Atlantic crashes below and the sky turns orange and gold. "I love you," she says against his lips. "I love you too. Always have, probably since that thunderstorm that never happened." "It's happening now," Astrid says, and pulls him close, the ring solid and real on her finger, the future bright and certain ahead of them.

**Chapter Arc**: Professional success → engagement planning → proposal and acceptance. Major relationship milestone: choosing to marry, making permanent commitment.

**Chapter End**: They call Emma and Rachel and Mrs. Chen with the news, everyone thrilled and celebrating. Back in London the next day, Astrid keeps looking at the ring, marveling at the reality of it. "We're engaged," she tells Gio, who's unimpressed. "For real this time." Benedict laughs, pulls her into his lap on the couch. "Should we tell people how we met? The full story?" "Eventually. Right now I just want to enjoy being engaged without explaining our checkered past." They spend the evening planning—nothing elaborate, they both agree. Something small and meaningful, surrounded by people they love. Maybe back in Cornwall, if Lord Ashford would host them. Full circle to where it began, but honest this time. Everything honest this time.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Wedding planning, professional milestones achieved, final resolutions.

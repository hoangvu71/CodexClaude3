# Chapter 3: Constructing the Narrative

**Transition from Previous**: Lord Ashford's secretary confirmed their visit for the following week. Now Astrid and Benedict meet at his apartment to prepare their cover story in detail.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Show Benedict's perspective, deepen character dynamics through backstory creation, establish their growing comfort with each other

**Scene 1 - Benedict's Apartment**: Benedict paces his Williamsburg loft while waiting for Astrid, aware that he's nervous in a way he hasn't been since his dissertation defense. The space reflects his scattered focus: bookshelves overflowing with cryptography texts and vintage paperbacks, whiteboards covered in half-erased equations, climbing gear in one corner, a keyboard pushed against the wall collecting dust since the divorce. He's tidied somewhat—moved the laundry, cleared the breakfast dishes—and now he's second-guessing the entire arrangement. When Astrid arrives precisely on time, she looks around his apartment with those appraising eyes, and he sees her cataloging details the way she'd catalog a book. She's dressed more casually than he's seen her—dark jeans, forest green sweater, hair in a ponytail instead of the usual bun—and he notices details he'd deliberately not noticed in the coffee shop: the gold flecks in her hazel eyes, the way she touches her necklace when uncertain, the fact that she's really quite lovely when she's not armoring herself in professional distance. He offers tea, which she accepts, and they settle at his dining table with notebooks and the understanding that they need to build a believable relationship history. The late afternoon light slants through the tall windows, and outside he can hear the sounds of Brooklyn—traffic, construction, someone's music—but inside there's a strange intimacy to this exercise, like they're writing fiction where they're the protagonists.

**Scene 2 - Building the Backstory**: They start with facts, working backward from now. Met six months ago on the forgery case—true. Reconnected a month ago—false, but plausible. Astrid suggests he contacted her about a book he'd seen at auction, wanted her expert opinion. Benedict counters with her contacting him about another cipher, more organic given her current project. They compromise: ran into each other at a lecture at the Morgan Library, went for coffee after, discovered shared interests beyond work. He watches her make notes, her handwriting smaller and neater than his scrawl. They build out details: first date (dinner in the West Village, Italian, they talked for four hours), second date (walking tour of rare bookshops, he bought her a vintage cryptography text), the moment things shifted from friendly to romantic (during a thunderstorm, sheltering in a bookshop doorway, he'd kissed her). Astrid hesitates when writing this, her pen hovering, and Benedict feels a strange flutter of something—curiosity maybe, or possibility—at the imagined scene. They create favorite memories: a weekend trip to Boston to see the Houghton Library, cooking disasters in his kitchen, inside jokes about terrible academic mysteries. The details feel real as they speak them into existence, and Benedict finds himself wishing some of them were true. He likes the version of himself in this story, the one who takes spontaneous weekend trips and isn't afraid of new connections.

**Scene 3 - The Personal Questions**: As the afternoon fades into evening, their preparation shifts from external facts to internal knowledge. If Lord Ashford asks personal questions—which his secretary suggested he would—they need to know each other beyond the surface. Astrid initiates this portion, asking about his family. Benedict finds himself telling the truth: parents divorced when he was twelve, father remarried and lives in Edinburgh, mother in Brighton, younger sister Emma who's a teacher. He asks about hers: she describes her grandmother who raised her partially, a librarian who died when Astrid was twenty-two and left her the cameo brooch she always wears. He sees emotion flicker across her face before she controls it. They trade information—favorite books (she: anything by Umberto Eco; he: "Gödel, Escher, Bach"), music (she: classical when working; he: post-punk and synthpop), fears (she: being ordinary; he: being alone with his thoughts, which is why he always has a puzzle to solve). The conversation becomes unexpectedly genuine, and Benedict realizes he's enjoying this, learning about the real Astrid beneath the professional facade. She asks about his divorce, and he considers deflecting but decides on honesty: "Clare needed someone present, and I was always elsewhere, lost in whatever problem I was solving. She wasn't wrong to leave." Astrid is quiet for a moment, then says, "My ex-fiancé chose a position across the country over staying. Said I was too focused on my career to build a real life anyway." There's pain under her matter-of-fact tone, and Benedict understands suddenly why she'd agreed to this deception—it's safer than risking the real thing. The realization makes him unbearably sad, for both of them.

**Scene 4 - The Practice Run**: Before Astrid leaves, Benedict suggests they practice—small gestures, casual intimacy, the kinds of things couples do without thinking. She agrees, clinical about it, and they stand in his living room trying on affection like costumes. He takes her hand, and she lets him, her fingers cool in his. They practice standing close, his arm around her shoulders, her leaning into him. It feels absurd and awkward until it doesn't, until his hand settles naturally at the small of her back and she relaxes against him with a sigh that sounds genuine. "We should practice kissing," Benedict hears himself say, then immediately regrets it when Astrid stiffens and steps back. "That's not—we don't need to—" she stumbles over words, flustered in a way he hasn't seen her, and he raises his hands in surrender. "Right, no, forget I said that. Overstepping." But she's looking at him with an expression he can't decode, something between fear and curiosity, and the moment stretches between them, charged and uncertain. Finally she says, "Let's just... see how things go. Improvise if necessary." He nods, relieved and disappointed in equal measure. She gathers her things, her notebook full of their fabricated history, and he walks her to the door. "One week," she says. "One week," he confirms. After she leaves, Benedict stands in his apartment surrounded by the evidence of their preparation—notes, empty tea cups, the lingering scent of her perfume (something with amber and paper, fitting)—and admits to himself that he might be in trouble. Because the version of himself in their cover story, the one who falls for the brilliant rare book appraiser, doesn't feel like fiction at all.

**Chapter Arc**: Nervous anticipation → collaborative creation → unexpected genuine connection → awareness of potential complication. Deepens both characters, shows their vulnerabilities, and establishes the danger of their fake relationship feeling too real.

**Chapter End**: Benedict alone in his apartment after Astrid leaves, looking at their notes. He picks up the page where she wrote "first kiss in thunderstorm" and feels the weight of a story they've invented but might want to live. Outside, actual thunder rumbles—a storm moving in—and he watches rain start to fall against the windows.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: The week before their departure; final preparations and travel to Cornwall.

# Chapter 28: First Days

**Transition from Previous**: Wedding night and honeymoon. Beginning married life and adjusting to new identity as spouses.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock-Shaw | **Purpose**: Show beginning of marriage, intimate moments, honeymoon period, transition to married life

**Scene 1 - Wedding Night**: After the reception ends and guests retire, Astrid and Benedict have the bedroom that was once theirs under false pretenses—the same four-poster bed, the same view of the Atlantic, but everything different now. They're married. Legal and real and permanent. "I can't believe we're here again," Astrid says, looking around the familiar room. "In this bed where we first slept together, terrified and lying." "Not lying by the end," Benedict reminds her. "We fell for each other in this room. Woke up tangled together and tried to pretend it was accidental." "Nothing about us was accidental," Astrid says. "Even the deception led somewhere true." They make love as married people—no performance, no audience, just them and the commitment they made and the future stretching ahead. Afterward, lying in the dark with the sound of waves below, Astrid says, "Mrs. Chen called me Dr. Whitlock-Shaw tonight. It sounded strange." "Do you like it?" "I do. It's both things—my professional identity and our partnership. Dr. Whitlock for work, Whitlock-Shaw for life." "Perfect compromise." Benedict kisses her forehead. "Like everything we do. Partnership." That word again, the one that's defined them from the beginning.

**Scene 2 - Honeymoon**: They spend a week in Cornwall for their honeymoon—not traveling elsewhere, just staying at a cottage near Ashford Hall, exploring the coast, being together without agenda or schedule. They walk the cliff paths, visit local bookshops, eat at village pubs, make love in the cottage with ocean view and complete privacy. It's blissfully ordinary and perfect. One afternoon, they return to Ashford Hall to say goodbye to Lord Ashford before heading back to London. He seems frailer than at the wedding, and Astrid feels a pang of concern. "Are you well?" "Old," he says with a gentle smile. "But content. Seeing you two married here, in the place where Sarah and I were happy—it brought me joy. Thank you for that gift." "Thank you for everything," Astrid says. "For forgiving us, for supporting us, for making this possible." "You made it possible by being brave enough to choose truth over deception, love over safety. I'm proud of you both." They hug him goodbye, and Astrid has the sense she's saying farewell to more than just a visit. Lord Ashford has become family, and she's grateful for every moment they've had with him.

**Scene 3 - Return to London**: Back in their Bloomsbury flat, Astrid and Benedict settle into married life. Astrid changes emergency contacts to "spouse," updates legal documents, tells colleagues she's now Dr. Whitlock-Shaw. Small changes that make the marriage real in practical ways. Work continues—Astrid has projects at the British Library, Benedict has research and writing. They fall into new rhythms: coffee together before commutes, evenings cooking dinner (badly but together), weekends exploring London or staying home with books and Gio. "Is it supposed to be this easy?" Astrid asks one evening. They're on the couch, both reading, feet tangled together, completely comfortable. "I thought marriage would be harder." "Maybe that's when it's right," Benedict says. "When partnership feels natural instead of forced." They have small disagreements—Benedict's continued messiness, Astrid's need to plan everything, scheduling conflicts between their jobs—but nothing that threatens their foundation. They've learned to communicate, compromise, choose each other even when it's inconvenient. One night, Astrid can't sleep. She gets up, walks through their home, looks at evidence of their marriage: rings on the nightstand, wedding photos on the shelf, combined library of their books, Gio sprawled across Benedict's climbing gear. This is real life. Not dramatic or crisis-driven, just two people building a home together, choosing partnership daily. Benedict finds her in the living room. "Okay?" "More than okay. I was just thinking—we did it. We built something real from fake beginnings. We survived crisis and threat and our own fears. And now we're just... married. Living our lives. It's almost anticlimactic." "Life is supposed to be anticlimactic after the wedding," Benedict says. "That's the point. Less drama, more partnership." "I like it." She leans against him. "The boring everyday life with you is better than the exciting crisis life was."

**Scene 4 - News**: A month after the wedding, they receive word that Lord Ashford has passed away peacefully in his sleep. The news hits Astrid hard—she knew he was elderly, knew their goodbye might be final, but grief still strikes deep. Benedict holds her while she cries for the man who gave them so much: access to the manuscript that started everything, forgiveness for their deception, blessing for their marriage, grace and generosity throughout. The funeral is in Cornwall, and they attend with heavy hearts. The small church is filled—local people who knew him, scholars who valued his collection, distant family. Benedict and Astrid sit together, holding hands, mourning someone who became unexpectedly important to their story. At the reception after, Lord Ashford's solicitor finds them. "He left something for you in his will." Astrid and Benedict exchange surprised glances. The solicitor hands them a letter in Lord Ashford's elegant handwriting and a small package. They open the letter privately in their car: "Dear Astrid and Benedict, If you're reading this, I've gone to join Sarah, which brings me comfort. Thank you for bringing joy and purpose to my final years. The manuscript discovery, your visits, your wedding—these things reminded me why preserving truth and celebrating love matter. In the package you'll find a small token: Sarah's favorite book, a medieval book of hours that she always said should belong to people who understand the value of historical beauty. Keep it, treasure it, and remember that complicated beginnings can lead to beautiful endings. With all my affection and blessing, Edmund Ashford." Inside the package is a stunning illuminated manuscript, 15th century, exquisitely preserved. Astrid handles it with reverence, tears streaming. "He gave us this. It's priceless." "He gave us his blessing and his trust," Benedict says. "The book is just a symbol." They cry together in the car outside the church, mourning a friend and celebrating a gift, grateful for the grace they were given.

**Chapter Arc**: Wedding night intimacy → honeymoon contentment → settling into married life → loss and legacy. Transition from wedding celebration to ordinary married life, with grief and gratitude interwoven.

**Chapter End**: That night, back in London, Astrid carefully places Sarah's book of hours on their shelf beside Lord Ashford's love poetry. Two gifts from two people who believed in them despite their imperfect beginning. "We should donate the book of hours to the British Library eventually," Astrid says. "In their names. Lord Ashford and Sarah, who understood the value of truth and love." "Perfect," Benedict agrees. They stand together looking at their growing collection—books they've acquired together, gifts from friends and family, the cover story notebook from their fake engagement, now artifacts of a real marriage. "I think we're going to be okay," Astrid says. "I think we're going to be better than okay," Benedict replies. "I think we're going to be happy." And holding each other in their home, surrounded by books and history and evidence of their life together, they know he's right.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Time passing, life continuing, final reflections.

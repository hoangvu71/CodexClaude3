# Chapter 6: Settling In

**Transition from Previous**: Several days into their stay at Ashford Hall. A routine has developed—days in the library, evenings with Lord Ashford, nights navigating their shared bedroom—and the lines between performance and reality continue to blur.

**POV**: Astrid Whitlock | **Purpose**: Show deepening domestic intimacy, advance cipher decryption, introduce Lord Ashford's past, build tension between professional goals and personal feelings

**Scene 1 - Morning Routine**: Astrid wakes to find Benedict already up, sitting in the window seat with his laptop and a cup of tea, working on cipher analysis in the grey dawn light. This has become their pattern—he's an early riser, she wakes to find him absorbed in work, and there's something unexpectedly comfortable about it, like they've been doing this for years instead of days. She watches him for a moment: the concentration on his face, the way he absently runs his hand through his already-disheveled hair, the morning stubble on his jaw. He's in sleep pants and a worn t-shirt for some band she doesn't recognize, barefoot, completely unselfconscious, and Astrid realizes this is the real Benedict Shaw, unguarded and focused. He looks up, catches her watching, and smiles—soft and genuine, no performance. "Morning. I made tea, if you want some." She does, joins him at the window seat, and they sit together looking out at the wild Cornish coast while discussing his progress on the cipher. It's intimate in a way that has nothing to do with the bed they're sharing and everything to do with this quiet morning space they're creating. Benedict explains that he's identified the key pattern—it's a variant of Bellaso's cipher, which makes sense for Cardano's era—but the actual key phrase is proving elusive. "I've tried obvious candidates: Latin phrases, medical terms, Cardano's own writings. Nothing fits perfectly." Astrid thinks, sipping her tea. "What about something personal? The cipher was for his own records. Maybe the key relates to his life, not his profession." Benedict looks at her with that expression he gets when she says something that shifts his thinking. "Brilliant. I'll work that angle." Their knees are touching on the window seat, and neither of them moves away.

**Scene 2 - Library Work and Conversation**: In the library, Astrid continues her meticulous documentation while Benedict works on decryption. Lord Ashford joins them mid-morning, bringing a stack of other Cardano materials from his collection for comparison—letters, a printed copy of Cardano's De Subtilitate, some astronomical charts. He settles in a chair to read, clearly enjoying having scholars in his library, the house alive again. Conversation drifts naturally between work and personal topics. Lord Ashford asks about their families, their childhoods, how they balance two demanding careers. Astrid finds herself telling true stories, just redirecting them slightly—her grandmother the librarian becomes "our shared love of books," Benedict's climbing becomes something they do together. The lies are getting easier, which should worry her but instead just makes her sad. What worries her more is how many of the stories she wishes were true. Lord Ashford tells them about Sarah, how they met at university, her work as a medieval historian, their decision to make Ashford Hall a haven for scholarship. "She wanted to open the collection to researchers," he says quietly. "I've been thinking... perhaps it's time. After you complete your work, of course." Astrid feels genuine warmth toward him, this lonely man trying to honor his wife's wishes, and the guilt about their deception intensifies. Benedict catches her eye across the library, and she sees her own discomfort reflected there. They're not just lying to a reclusive collector; they're lying to someone kind, grieving, generous. Later, when Lord Ashford steps out, Benedict says quietly, "We could tell him the truth." Astrid looks at him, startled. "We can't. He'd ask us to leave." "Would he? He seems to like us genuinely, not just as a couple." It's tempting, but Astrid thinks about the partnership, the manuscript, how much depends on completing this work. "After," she says. "When the authentication is done. We can explain then." Benedict nods, but neither of them feels good about it.

**Scene 3 - Evening Walk**: After dinner, Lord Ashford suggests they walk the cliff gardens while the weather holds. It's late November, cold and clear, the sun setting over the Atlantic in brilliant oranges and purples. Astrid bundles in her coat and scarf, and Benedict takes her hand as they follow the garden paths, the gesture automatic now. Lord Ashford walks ahead with his own memories, giving them space, and Astrid realizes they're alone together in the dying light, the sound of waves crashing below and seabirds calling. "It's beautiful here," she says. "Isolated," Benedict replies, "but yes, beautiful." He's close, their joined hands between them, and Astrid is acutely aware of his warmth in the cold air. They reach a viewpoint where the path meets the cliff edge, protected by an old stone wall, and stand looking out at the darkening sea. "Can I ask you something?" Benedict says. "About Steven. Your ex." Astrid tenses, but nods. "What happened? Really?" She's quiet for a long moment, watching the waves. "He got a position at Berkeley. Asked me to come with him, but I'd just started at Marlowe & Sons, had built my reputation there. We argued. He said I cared more about old books than our future, that I was using my career to avoid real intimacy." The words hurt even now, two years later. "I told him he was choosing ambition over us, that if he really loved me he'd stay or at least wait. He left anyway." Benedict is silent, and when Astrid looks at him his expression is complicated. "Was he right? About the intimacy?" It's a sharp question, the kind that should offend, but his tone is gentle, genuinely curious. Astrid makes herself consider it honestly. "Maybe. Partially. I do use work as a shield sometimes. But he was doing the same thing—his career mattered more than mine, his ambitions were more important. It wasn't really love, I don't think. Just... compatible loneliness." "I understand that," Benedict says quietly. "Clare and I—we were both so absorbed in our own work, our own puzzles. I thought love was just finding someone who didn't mind being ignored." He laughs bitterly. "Turns out that's not actually a foundation for marriage." They're both silent, and then Astrid asks, "Is this different? What we're doing here?" The question hangs between them, loaded with meaning. Benedict turns to face her fully, still holding her hand. "Yes," he says simply. "Because I'm not ignoring you. I can't, even when I try." Astrid's breath catches, and they're standing very close now, the cold forgotten, just the two of them and the wild coast and the truth neither wants to fully acknowledge.

**Scene 4 - Return to Reality**: Lord Ashford calls to them from the path—it's getting dark, they should head back—and the moment breaks. Walking back to the house, Lord Ashford between them now, chatting about tomorrow's plans, Astrid feels disoriented. What just happened on the cliff? What did Benedict mean? What did she want him to mean? In their bedroom that night, they prepare for bed in their now-familiar dance of careful privacy. But when they're both in bed, lights off, the darkness feels different. Charged. "Astrid," Benedict says quietly. "Today, at the cliff—" "We should sleep," she interrupts, her heart pounding. "Long day tomorrow." Silence. Then: "Right. Yes." But she can feel him there in the darkness, close but not touching, and she knows he's as awake as she is. Eventually she hears his breathing slow into sleep, but Astrid stays awake much longer, staring at the ceiling and trying to untangle professional necessity from personal desire from the terrifying possibility that she's falling for someone in the middle of the most elaborate lie she's ever told. When she finally sleeps, she dreams of cliff edges and falling, and wakes in the grey pre-dawn to find herself pressed against Benedict's chest, his arms around her, both of them seeking comfort in sleep that they won't acknowledge awake. She carefully extricates herself before he wakes, but she can still feel the warmth of him, the steady beat of his heart, and she knows she's in trouble far deeper than any manuscript authentication.

---

**Chapter Arc**: Comfortable domestic intimacy → growing guilt about deception → moment of emotional vulnerability and near-confession → retreat into denial. Deepens emotional complexity, shows both characters recognizing developing feelings but afraid to act on them.

**Chapter End**: Astrid in the bathroom, staring at her reflection in the mirror. Her hair is tangled from sleep, her eyes shadowed with exhaustion and confusion. She touches her own face, wondering who she's becoming in this place—someone who lies easily, who sleeps wrapped around a man she's supposed to be faking with, who wants things she can't name. Through the door, she hears Benedict moving around, starting his day. The routine they've built. She takes a breath, steadies herself, and prepares to maintain the performance for another day.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Continued work on the manuscript, breakthrough in decryption, outside world intruding.

# Chapter 21: Departures

**Transition from Previous**: Final weeks in New York before the London move. Saying goodbyes, finishing preparations, closing one chapter and opening another.

**POV**: Benedict Shaw | **Purpose**: Show goodbyes and endings, transition between old life and new, emotional preparation for next chapter, set up Act 3

**Scene 1 - Benedict's Goodbye**: Benedict's department holds a farewell reception for him—colleagues, students, friends from his years at the university. It's bittersweet; he's excited about Oxford but aware he's leaving behind community and familiarity. Clare attends, which surprises him until she explains: "We were colleagues before we were married. I'm allowed to see you off." They talk privately, and it's cordial and final in a good way. "I'm glad you found her," Clare says, watching Astrid across the room chatting with Benedict's advisor. "Someone who balances you instead of mirroring you." "She does." Benedict watches Astrid too, animated and engaged, completely at ease even though she knows almost no one here. "What we had was real, but it wasn't right. What you have with her is both." It's closure, gentle and mutual, and Benedict feels grateful for it. Later, his sister Emma video calls from Edinburgh. "Excited for Oxford?" "Terrified," he admits. "New country, new job, living with someone for the first time since the divorce. What if I'm terrible at it?" "You probably will be sometimes," Emma says cheerfully. "But so will she. That's relationships—being terrible and forgiving each other and trying to be better." Simple wisdom, but it helps. Benedict commits to trying to be better, to being present, to not getting lost in his work and forgetting Astrid exists. He wants this to work more than he's wanted anything.

**Scene 2 - Astrid's Goodbye**: Astrid meets Rachel Kim for one last coffee before the move. Her best friend is happy for her but sad to see her go. "London," Rachel says. "You're really doing it. New job, new country, living with the cryptographer." "I'm really doing it." Astrid still can't quite believe it herself. "And you're sure? About all of it? Because if you have doubts—" "I have doubts about everything, you know that. But the doubts aren't big enough to stop me. I want this life with Benedict. I want the British Library. I want the fresh start." Rachel reaches across the table, takes her hand. "Then I'm happy for you. But I'll miss you terribly." "I'll miss you too." They promise video calls, visits, maintaining their friendship across the Atlantic. That evening, Astrid has dinner with her grandmother's old friend Mrs. Chen, who's been like family since Astrid's grandmother passed. "She'd be proud of you," Mrs. Chen says, touching the cameo brooch Astrid always wears—her grandmother's last gift. "Taking risks, following your heart. She always said you were too cautious." "Was I?" Astrid asks. "Maybe. But you're not anymore. This move, this relationship—you're being brave." Brave. Astrid tests the word, decides she likes it. She is being brave, choosing vulnerability over safety, building something new from the ashes of her carefully controlled life.

**Scene 3 - The Move**: Moving day is controlled chaos. Shipping company taking boxes, last-minute packing, apartment emptying out. Benedict is there helping, and Astrid is grateful for his steady presence as her life gets dismantled and compressed into labeled boxes. They do final walkthrough of her empty apartment—the place she's lived for five years, that represented her independence and success. She thought she'd feel sadder, but mostly she feels ready. "Goodbye, New York," she says at the window, looking out at the city one last time. "You were good to me, but it's time for something new." Benedict wraps his arms around her from behind. "Any regrets?" "About leaving? No. About us? Never." They fly to London together, all their worldly possessions somewhere in transit, stepping into the unknown. The flight is long, and they sleep fitfully, wake over the Atlantic somewhere between their old life and new one. "What if we hate London?" Astrid asks in the dark cabin. "What if the jobs are terrible and we're miserable and we made a huge mistake?" "Then we try something else," Benedict says. "Go somewhere new, find different jobs. We're not locked in forever." "You'd really do that? Give up Oxford if it doesn't work?" "I'd give up anything if it means keeping you." The certainty in his voice settles Astrid's anxiety. They're not just moving to London—they're choosing each other continuously, in big decisions and small ones.

**Scene 4 - Arrival**: London in January is grey and cold and beautiful. They take a cab from Heathrow to their Bloomsbury flat, and the letting agent meets them with keys. The apartment is empty, echoing, waiting for them to make it home. Astrid walks through the rooms—main bedroom with high ceilings, smaller bedroom that will be her office, kitchen with actual counter space, living room with the bookshelves that sold them on the place. Windows that open onto a quiet street, different from New York's constant noise. "What do you think?" Benedict asks, watching her explore. "I think it's perfect." They spend the first day buying absolute necessities—air mattress, coffee maker, basic groceries. Their shipped belongings won't arrive for weeks, so the apartment is sparse and temporary, but it's theirs. That night they lie on the air mattress in the empty bedroom, exhausted but too wired to sleep. London sounds different than New York—quieter, different traffic patterns, different city rhythm. "We live together now," Astrid says into the darkness. "We do." "How do you feel?" "Happy. Terrified. Hopeful. You?" "All of that." She rolls toward him, finds his hand. "I love you." "I love you too." They fall asleep in their new home, in their new city, in their new life, holding each other through the uncertainty and the possibility.

**Chapter Arc**: Saying goodbyes → emotional preparation → physical move → arrival in new life. Act 2 conclusion: old chapter closed, new one beginning, committed to building future together.

**Chapter End**: Morning light in London, weak January sun through bare windows. Astrid wakes to Benedict already awake, watching her. "Morning," she says. "Morning. First morning in our home." Astrid looks around the empty room that will become familiar, that will hold their books and their life and their love. "First of many," she says. "I hope so," Benedict replies. And they get up to start building their future, one morning at a time.

**Transition to Next Chapter**: Settling into London, starting new jobs, building domestic life together.
